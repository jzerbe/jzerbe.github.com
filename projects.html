            I enjoy collaborating on scaled projects and hacking on a (10 year)
            backlog of personal projects. Some of the more note-worthy and
            contract work you will find below.

            Currently, I am: 1) Part of a start-up working on a service to help
            people better manage an evening&#39;s events.
            2) Building a whole-home audio zone solution
            controlled via any JavaScript enabled browser.

            <h3>MusicZones - August 2011 to Present</h3>
            <p>
                Software for creating a whole-home audio system. J2SE (requires 1.6)
                version running on screenless laptops in my home since mid August (2011).<br />
                <br />
                Software system runs on any Windows/Mac/Linux machine and controlled by
                any relatively modern JavaScript enabled web browser, including mobile browsers
                (using the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile framework</a>).<br />
                <br />
                Standard application requires that a <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a>
                binary be present in the system somewhere. I suggest
                <a href="http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/">SMPlayer</a>
                for Windows, (apt-get install) mplayer for Linux (or equivalent), or
                <a href="http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net/">MPlayerOSX</a> for OSX.<br />
                <br />

                small form-factor commodity Android devices w/o need for external mplayer binary.<br />

            <h3>Thrifty Wrench - March 2011</h3>
            <p>
                After spending several months trying to find an internship for the summer,
                I was messaged by Jon Stojan, wondering if I could come work on Thrifty Wrench.
                He said he was &quot;looking for a talented local programmer to help create
                an online system to connect automotive businesses to local customers&quot;.
                I did not end up &quot;interning&quot; on his project this summer, but we came to a
                contract agreement instead. I overhauled quite a bit of the legacy database
                (PHP/MySQL) code and added new form validation JavaScript. I highly recommend using
                <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation">jQuery&#39;s Validation Plugin</a>,
                which is a really slick way of doing Ajax validation calls.

            <h3>free web access from T-Mobile - September 2010, January 2011</h3>
            <p>
                After many unsuccessful attempts to use my various mobile phones as data modems to
                dial-in to my home network, I &quot;accidentally&quot; figured out that I could
                get free web access as long as the keyword &quot;tmobile&quot; was in the URL
                somewhere. So I initially built this semi-private web proxy - tmobile.vraidsys.com - optimized
                for mobile devices using the Glype framework. Here is the main idea for DIY types:
                <a href="http://modmyi.com/forums/t-mobile/723747-how-roll-your-own-proxy-browse-edge-free.html" rel="nofollow">
                    http://modmyi.com/forums/t-mobile/723747-how-roll-your-own-proxy-browse-edge-free.html
                </a>.<br />
                <br />
                I had always been hoping to build a better system than using web proxies and crappy
                built-in cell phone browsers. Ever heard of <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a>?
                In my opinion, it is by far one of the best browsers for mobile devices. Although,
                it is not exactly a real browser, as all of the &quot;mobilizing&quot; and markup interpretation
                is done on Opera&#39;s servers; think of it more as a thin client. Anyways,
                I mapped two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME</a>s
                tmobile4.vraidsys.com and tmobile4-1.vraidsys.com to server4.operamini.com, and
                updated the v4 advanced jar. Presto! Free mobile web access through loopholes in the
                T-Mobile service. For more information and download links see this blog post:

            <h3>nate.uri|DESIGNS - June to August 2010</h3>
            <p>
                I was able to work with Nate during the summer of 2010. First,
                a probationary gig, and then he continued to hand off some pretty serious
                stuff, along with the usual xHTML/CSS/jQuery stuffs that I get quite often.
                Did some things with jQuery and PNG layering that should be done with Flash.
                But hey ... why not? Search engines like text. Anyways ... cools things continued
                to happen.  Ever heard of <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>?

                <a href="http://plumeblue.com/">Plume Blume</a>. I also had the
                chance to integrate the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/index">Twilio API</a>
                into Plume Blue.

            <h3>Swizz Apparel Co. Facebook App - October 2009</h3>
            <p>
                I built this e-commerce Facebook app for Ethan Schweizer as an easy way to sell and market his
                <i>Swizz Apparel</i> line of clothes. The cool things about this is that it provides a
                more private merchandise area than the general Facebook Marketplace with the added bonus of
                going viral. Purchases can be made seamlessly through PayPal without installing app by
                visiting the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Swizz.Apparel.Co">Swizz Apparel Co. Facebook page</a>.
                In addition I managed the PHP/MySQL backend hosting.

                I met Henry Passot, co-owner of
                <a href="http://www.essentialservicesinc.com/">Essential Services Inc</a>
                at a Starbucks and he had me build a <a href="http://flowplayer.org/">FlowPlayer</a>
                component implemented on several websites (that I cannot name due to our business agreement)
                that works flawlessly with IE 6-8, FF, Chrome, Opera and Safari. At which point I
                became his goto guy for more code-intensive parts of web-design, SEO, and widgets.
                I created several wordpress installations and Themes, a Javascript captcha
                component based on <a href="http://www.archreality.com/jcap/">jcap</a>
                that protects several high-profile businesses. Along with the many hours of
                troubleshooting, support, and upkeep of development/production environments.

            <p>
                I got lucky when I met Gyuri Papp after responding to a craigslist posting.
                During that summer he was into social games. Gyuri had me working on the
                <i>I Am Rich</i> <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/iamrichfb/">Facebook</a>
                and <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/Modules/Applications/Pages/Canvas.aspx?appId=130038">MySpace</a>
                applications. In addition, my Linux knowledge came into play and I did some work on
                <a href="http://www.solitechgmbh.com/">SoliTech</a>&#39;s production servers.

                I first met <a href="http://yuriahsouder.weebly.com/">Yuriah Souder</a>
                in a Western Philosophy class at <a href="http://www.century.edu/">Century College</a>.
                He had this new apparel company idea that he was starting with Erik Brust.
                Yuri got me on board after learning that I build websites.
                A few of the things I did with them:<br />
                1) custom flash animation using the HullaBaloon brand<br />
                2) integration of PayPal shopping cart and checkout<br />
                3) custom CSS and xHTML design that works in all major browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari)<br />
                4) WordPress integration/theming<br />
                5) managed web (via <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>)
                and email hosting (from <a href="http://www.google.com/apps">Google Apps</a>)<br />

            <p>
                This was an early PHP/MySQL/Ajax web app I created for order tracking.
                I made a simple xHTML 1.0 Strict &amp; CSS level 2.1 template. I put together
                an easy to use setup script for autogenerating .htaccess and MySQL table stuffs.
                Integrated a JavaScript date picker and made some Ajax edit locking and updating.

            <p>
                This project has been sitting on the back burner for quite some time now.
                The idea is to use IPv6 and its built-in multicast capabilities to allow
                musicians to jam and record together online. The client is written completely
                in Java and is managed by a webservice written in Python, running off of
                <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>. The client makes use
                of UPNPLib by (now defunct) SBBI.net for NAT auto-configuration.
