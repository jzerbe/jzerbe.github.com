## Career Profile
With a background in software development, machine learning, and data solutions,
I help businesses leverage the power of data to drive innovation, efficiency, and growth.
As an Enterprise Solutions Architect at Immuta, I lead technical demos, workshops,
and evaluations to showcase the value of our data security platform.

In addition to my role at Immuta, I am also a Director at Vraid Systems Limited,
where I create new technology assisted solutions in various domains, such as construction,
