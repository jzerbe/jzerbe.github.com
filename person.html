        <h1 class="post-title">The Lead</h1>

        A generalist focused on getting to "Yes".
        My career has been defined by a transition from the abstract to the tangible - moving from
        designing data architectures to optimizing the physical flow of goods across borders.
        Whether it is a data pipeline or a supply chain, the core interest remains the same: Systems.
        I am analytical at the high level, intuitive at the low level,
        and unapologetically unconventional in my approach.

        My work has always been at the intersection of complex data and high-stakes decision-making:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Intelligence & Governance: At Immuta, I designed data provisioning solutions for enterprise clients,
                leading evaluations to ensure stakeholders made the right buying decisions for their data platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                AI & Search: As a Technical Product Owner at Koverse, I led the development of AI-guided
                search products and built operational processes for intelligence products designed for non-technical decision-makers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Energy & Environment: At Tendril Networks, I managed the launch of novel machine learning technology
                for smart-thermostat load shifting. This system reduced business costs by 80% and secured multi-million
                dollar contracts with major utilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Compliance & Scale: At Workiva, I contributed to the Digital Review suite used for SEC and SOX
                compliance, helping scale a platform where usage tripled during my tenure.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="post-title">The Current Venture: Vraid Systems</h1>

        In 2020, I took my background in data engineering and applied it to the "dirt" and "grit" of global logistics.
        As the General Manager of Vraid Systems, I focus on delivering consumer electronics, telecom equipment,
        and lab disposables faster and more efficiently than traditional players.
        <br />
        <br />
        My goal is to strip away the friction from physical
        trade using the same rigor I once applied to software re-architecture.

        <h1 class="post-title">The Personal Stack</h1>

        I am not just a founder; I am a practitioner of the integrated life.
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Research</b>: I was a licensed Investment Advisor Representative, a role that fuels my
                interest in arbitrage and the mechanics of the US caste system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Field</b>: When I’m not analyzing supply chains or writing "field notes",
                I’m likely on a splitboard or mountain bike, navigating the same rugged landscapes where
                our mining and ranching clients operate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Lifestyle</b>: I enjoy working hard on difficult problems when my mind needs exercise.
                How I make money, how I structure my day, how I grow and find purpose in this life must be complimentary.

                with an emphasis on Databases and Networking: the original "logistics" of the digital world.
