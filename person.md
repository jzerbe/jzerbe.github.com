## Lead
A generalist focused on getting to "Yes".
My career has been defined by a transition from the abstract to the tangible: moving from
designing data architectures to optimizing the physical flow of goods across borders.
Whether it is a data pipeline or a supply chain, the core interest remains the same: Systems.
I am analytical at the high level, intuitive at the low level,
and unapologetically unconventional in my approach.

## Architecture of a Career
I spent 15 years building software that powers modern industry.

My work has always been at the intersection of complex data and high-stakes decision-making:
- __Intelligence & Governance__: At Immuta, I designed data provisioning solutions for enterprise clients,
leading evaluations to ensure stakeholders made the right buying decisions for their data platforms.
- __AI & Search__: As a Technical Product Owner at Koverse, I led the development of AI-guided
search products and built operational processes for intelligence products designed for non-technical decision-makers.
- __Energy & Environment__: At Tendril Networks, I managed the launch of novel machine learning technology
for smart-thermostat load shifting. This system reduced business costs by 80% and secured multi-million
dollar contracts with major utilities.
- __Compliance & Scale__: At Workiva, I contributed to the Digital Review suite used for SEC and SOX
compliance, helping scale a platform where usage tripled during my tenure.

## Current Venture: Vraid Systems
In 2020, I took my background in data engineering and applied it to the "dirt" and "grit" of global logistics.
As the General Manager of Vraid Systems, I focus on delivering construction materials, telecom equipment,
lab disposables, and consumer packaged goods faster and more efficiently than traditional players.

My goal is to strip away the friction from physical
trade using the same rigor I once applied to software re-architecture.

## Personal Stack
I am not just a founder; I am a practitioner of the integrated life.
- __Research__: I was a licensed Investment Advisor Representative, a role that fuels my
interest in arbitrage and the mechanics of the US caste system.
- __The Field__: When I’m not analyzing supply chains or writing "field notes",
I’m likely on a splitboard or mountain bike, navigating the same rugged landscapes where
our mining and ranching clients operate.
- __Lifestyle__: I enjoy working hard on difficult problems when my mind needs exercise.
How I make money, how I structure my day, how I grow and find purpose in this life must be complimentary.

- __Foundation__: I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota,
with an emphasis on Databases and Networking: the original "logistics" of the digital world.
