This is the second of three days spent around Las Vegas doing non-Vegas things.

### Death Valley Buttes
I agree with _you get a whole lotta something for a whole lotta nothin_ from
[SummitPost : Death Valley Buttes](http://www.summitpost.org/death-valley-buttes/153730).
In two hours we were able to break out of the Daylight Pass valley and see to
the [Harmony Borax Works](http://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/harmony.htm),
and [Mesquite Flat Dunes](http://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/sand-dunes.htm).

Got going on this ~10:30am after a
[30 minute drive from Beatty to a dirt turn-out](https://goo.gl/maps/p0PCu).
The noticeable [start of the trail](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/rj2fpc9eoaor6vl/AAB-pkNQWH5Q0MM9dFUhxrHFa)
on the Eastern most Butte is around the second outcrop as
[seen from the turn-out](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/1aob5mih8vpbczh/AADFmN_etY5PpDLoOdalk3zVa).
Shielded from the North wind much of the trail.

Point forecast: [19 MILES NNW FURNACE CREEK CA](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=36.7112492&lon=-117.0044536)

### Eats and Sleeps
Chowed down some sandwiches at the junction of Scotty's Castle Road and
Daylight Pass Road; has a pit toilet and picnic table. This was after getting
[chased off some dunes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5YlBlckgxUXd3a0E)
farther North along Scotty's Castle Road by an incoming sandstorm.

Drove back to Las Vegas.

[Origin India](http://www.originindiarestaurant.com/) was open on Christmas Day
and we were able to be seated right away ~7pm. Absolutely delicious. Much better
than some casino buffet.

Sleeps at [Alexis Park All Suite Resort](http://www.alexispark.com/), which has
a weird WiFi policy: free, if you sign in for the first time, in the main building.
