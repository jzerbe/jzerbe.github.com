I needed a fast and efficient way to edit all of my wordpress posts in bulk the other day.
So I wrote a script that looks for a certain search string in a post and replaces that search
string with another string.
Just remove the .txt extension, configure the search and replace varz, upload to the directory
containing your wp-config.php file, and access with your web client.<br />
REMEMBER TO REMOVE THIS POWERFUL SCRIPT AFTER USE!<br />
