I needed a fast and officiant way to edit all of my wordpress posts in bulk the other day. So I wrote a script that looks for a certain search string in a post and replaces that search string with another string. Fast efficient and easy to auto-edit all of your word press posts. Just remove the .txt extension, configure the search and replace varz, upload to the directory containing your wp-config.php file, and access with your web client. REMEMBER TO REMOVE THIS POWERFUL SCRIPT AFTER USE! <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44649188/blog_includes/article-includes/editposts.php.txt">editposts.php.txt</a>
