I really wanted to do
[Lost Palm Oasis](http://modernhiker.com/2013/02/20/hiking-lost-palms-oasis/),
but due to mine tailings being churned up, the trails that start from the
[Cottonwood area are closed](http://www.nps.gov/jotr/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageID=674712)
in the South-end of the park.

###Timetable
- 12:50pm start from the trailhead parking lot.
- 1:25pm summit.
- 1:30pm leave summit.
- 2:00pm return to summit with rest of family.
- 2:20pm leave summit.
- 3:00pm return to trailhead parking lot.

0:35 ascent. 0:40 descent. Have to watch for ankle-twisting steps on the descent.
Pretty hard to get lost on this trail and the hiker density was low enough
to jog portions of this.

About 1000ft elevation gain over 1.5 miles.
