La Plata is situated to the South side of
[CO SH 82](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_Highway_82),
and SWW of
[Twin Lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Lakes,_Lake_County,_Colorado).
Twin Lakes is a good base camp to do a variety of things in South
Lake county: hot springs farther South along 24, various peaks, and
trails around the lakes. Forget exactly which
[cabin rental](http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/colorado/south-central/twin-lakes)
went through 5 years ago, but we landed some sweet digs in the hills on the North
side of town. I digress.

I showed up to the trailhead a bit after 8am, and managed to steal
a parking spot in the _designated parking area_ from someone as they
drove away. One could park farther down the access road that was packed
from people camping. Did not want to risk losing a mirror.

Mentally prepare yourself for __3 false summits__.


###Timetable###
- 8:15am start from the [La Plata Gulch Trailhead](https://goo.gl/maps/WAvnh)
- 9:05am clear treeline
- 10:40am summit La Plata
- 11:10am leave summit
- 1:10pm return to car

Be sure to stay to the right on the return, otherwise you will do part of
the [Southwest Ridge](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=lapl2&peak=La+Plata+Peak)
route like I did.

Once back below treeline, in the valley, the pine forest to the East of the
trail offers cover for finding a friendly tree, but beware of mosquitoes
whiling bearing yourself.
