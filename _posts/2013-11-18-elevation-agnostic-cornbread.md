This cornbread recipe works very well ~1000ft or ~6000ft. As an added bonus, it is resilient against old ovens.

###Ingredients###
Works well for a 9.5x13.5x2 inch glass baking dish.

- `2.5 cups` flour
- `1.5 cups` corn meal
- `0.5 cup` sugar for more dessert-like __or__ `0.25` for general purpose use with beans, salsa, lettuce, cheese
- `4 teaspoons` baking powder
- `0.5 teaspoon` salt. Original says same amount for half of this recipe; sodium much?
- `2 cups` skim milk
- `0.5 cup` vegetable oil
- `2` eggs

###Instructions###
1. (Optional) grease cooking dish. The glass baking dish I use, never needs this.
2. Original says to heat oven to 400F. I typically go 410F __or__ 375F on convect bake in a new oven.
3. Mixup dry ingredients. Form bowl in center of dry ingredients.
4. Mixup eggs in center of bowl. Add remaining wet ingredients and mix all together until combined.
5. Original says bake 20-25 minutes. For newer/more powerful ovens I go 22 minutes,
turn off the heat, and keep it in the oven for 5-10 more minutes. For older ovens I leave it in for
the full 25 minutes, and keep it in the oven for ~5 minutes after turning off the oven.
