[Pike and San Isabel National Forests](http://www.fs.usda.gov/psicc/)
run Southeast from Frisco to Colorado Springs, hemmed in by CO-9, US-24, I-25, I-70;
quite an area.

The two __out and back__ trails in this post are located just South of
[Divide, CO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide,_Colorado)
and East of [Mueller State Park](http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/Mueller).
Based on the [pictures and activity levels at Mueller](https://twitter.com/search?q=Mueller%20State%20Park),
I would guess that by late May, most years these two trails are always snow-free.

I started ~9:15am from the trailhead parking on _Teller County Road 62_ up the
_Raspberry Mountain_ trail. Take a few switchbacks up to the ridgeline and you have
already cleared most of the elevation gain. Just be sure to stay on the old road,
as once you are along the ridge, there are various places where you can go down
onto private property and other public trails. The last mile is great singletrack
through pine forest, then a mix of aspen and pine, before opening onto a bulge
of rocks. Quite nice early in the season. Shaded through the pine forest, but
not much else. Met 5 people on my way down. No facilities.

I returned to my car a bit after 11am and continued driving SE on 62 for a few
miles to the next trailhead.

_The Crags_ parking is pretty hard to miss by late morning; the level of
families flocking about is high. There is a quick bit of elevation gain in the
first quarter-mile, and 500 ft or so of uphill in the last mile, but for the
most part it stays quite level next to _Fourmile Creek_. The boulders at the
end are fun to mess around on. I am not one for lunching on trails, but I would
say this might be a good place for it. Shade in the last mile through a pine
forest; exposed for the rest of the time. Pit toilets at trailhead.

I ended by lunching with the windows down and the air blowing, driving back
into town.
