The original back of the can base recipe was all frozen or canned ingredients.
I added in some quick chopping and dicing for a more interesting flavor and
diverse vitamin content, but you can still go from nothing to something in short order.
I have a `12 inch` diameter by `3 inch` deep Calphalon nonstick covered pan
that I am able to do everything for this two part recipe in.

###Saute Ingredients
- `6x1.5 inch` zucchini which comes loosely to `2-3 cups` in quarter inch slices
- `3x1.5 inch` jalapeno (double thumb girth and a bit longer - excluding stem) which is about `0.5 cups`
diced (to release capsaicin). For those of you serving this to _midwestern_ relatives, they will think it is
plenty spicy enough without any jalapeno.
- `1 cup` diced (around half inch chunks) white onions
- _OPTIONAL_ `< 0.5 cups` leftover green onions. I put them in during this stage if they are old, otherwise I will
garnish serving bowls with a spritzing if they are in good condition.
- `0.25 cup` olive oil - pure (cheaper) or extra virgin makes no remarkable taste difference

###Boiling Ingredients
- `15 oz` can of [Kuner Black Beans with Cumin & Chili Spices](http://www.faribaultfoods.com/brands/kuners_sw/)
- `15 oz` can of diced tomatoes
- `1-2 cups` water from rinsing out spices/extras from cans. Useful to have this wiggle room if augmenting.
- `0.75 cups` each of frozen peas and corn
- _OPTIONAL_ `0.75 cups` each of sweet/standard potatoes, yams, or squash (spaghetti, acorn), and rice.
I usually throw in some kind of leftover root starch or rice to thicken things up,
instead of boiling excess water off, and to turn the dish into a complete source of protein.

###Process
1. Throw all the saute ingredients together in the pan, cover, and saute in the olive oil on high.
I typically lay a bed of zucchini, followed by the onion(s) and diced jalapeno.
2. Flip the stack occasionally and cook until around `50%` of the zucchini mass is browned, and the white onions are browned.
3. Dump the beans, tomatoes, and can rinse water in. Leave the pan uncovered for the remainder of the cooking process.
4. Turn down the heat to medium-high, and stir it all up.
5. Dump everything else in once the mixture has come to a full boil again.
6. Stirring, leave on full boil for `5 minutes`, or until consistency has thickened to your liking, and then turn off heat.
7. Let sit on heat for another `5 minutes` or so.
8. Serve with sour cream, cheese, and maybe some corn chips or corn bread.
