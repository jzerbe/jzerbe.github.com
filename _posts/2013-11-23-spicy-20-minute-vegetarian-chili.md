The original back of the can base recipe was all frozen or canned ingredients.
I added in some quick chopping and dicing for a more interesting flavor and
diverse vitamin content, but you can still go from nothing to something in short order.
I have a `12 inch` diameter by `3 inch` deep Calphalon nonstick covered pan
that I am able to do everything for this three part recipe in.

### Saute Ingredients
- `6x1.5 inch` zucchini which comes loosely to `2-3 cups` in quarter inch slices
- `1` anaheim pepper diced
- `2` x `3x1.5 inch` jalapenos (double thumb girth and a bit longer - excluding stem) which is about `1 cup`
diced (to release capsaicin). For those of you serving this to _midwestern_ relatives, they will think it is
plenty spicy enough without any hot peppers.
- `1 cup` diced (around half inch chunks) white onions __OR__ a diced bundle of green onions
- `0.25 cup` olive oil - pure (cheaper) or extra virgin makes no remarkable taste difference

### Frying Ingredients
- `0.75 cups` rice
- `0.75 cups` each of frozen peas and corn

### Boiling Ingredients
- `15 oz` can of [Kuner Black Beans with Cumin & Chili Spices](http://www.faribaultfoods.com/brands/kuners_sw/)
- `15 oz` can of diced tomatoes
- `1-1.5 cups` water from rinsing out spices/extras from cans in pan. Prevents bottom of pan burning as you are boiling down.
- `0.25 cup` refried beans
- `0.25 - 0.5 cup` [roasted green chiles](https://www.505southwestern.com/roasted-chiles)
- `0.75 cups` acorn or spaghetti squash

### Process
1. Add the _Saute Ingredients_. Saute in the olive oil on high. Looking for 50% browned.
1. Add the _Frying Ingredients_. Think fried rice-ish. 
1. Add the _Boiling Ingredients_. Leave the pan uncovered for the remainder of the cooking process.
1. Stirring occasionally, leave on full boil for `10-15 minutes`, or until consistency has thickened to your liking, and then turn off heat.
1. Let sit on heat for another `5 minutes` or so.
1. Serve with fresh chives/green onions, sour cream, cheese, and some corn chips or corn bread.
