A quick bike route that I was able to fit in Saturday morning on my low-tech
29er. Was a bit soggy, but nothing wrong with getting muddy; ended up getting
out 2 cups of hardened muck from my bike the next day.
I did want to add some mileage by doing _Rim Rock_ trail, but found out that it
is closed from March 1- July 31 for bird nesting. Started from the trailhead
right around 9am, got back down a bit after 10am; saw 5 people.

The East access to
[White Ranch Park](http://jeffco.us/parks/parks-and-trails/white-ranch-park/)
from _CO-93_ seemed to have heavy traffic right around when I was starting.
