This is the first of three days spent around Las Vegas doing non-Vegas things.

### Tuesday night accommodations
Had two _Tower Queen_ rooms at Excalibur, Christmas eve-eve, for
~$130 including the always funny _resort fee_. The rooms were quite nice.
Great [view of concrete](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B611viYGQAn5NjU2NlFobUFzZTQ/view?usp=sharing).
Note that if you are close enough to the smokey gaming floor you can mooch the
free WiFi. Great for syncing maps.

### Wednesday mid-morning drive
The drive from [Excalibur to Dantes View](https://goo.gl/maps/4S4AN) is
mostly [arid shrub](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5bGZOTjhqaDBHMFk)
but, it does get interesting as you go through
[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area](http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/fo/lvfo/blm_programs/blm_special_areas/red_rock_nca.html)
and once you leave the flood plain surrounding the
[Amargosa Opera House](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5Ym4wcVNlczhVMlU).
Once you start descending into Death Valley Nation Park, you get to see
[striated cliffs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5QV9WT0tsblJxT28).

### Dantes better View
If you want to do better than [viewing](http://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?id=F3BD499E-155D-4519-3E9E9CB9799EA446)
the
[Badwater Basin](http://www.nps.gov/photosmultimedia/photogallery.htm?id=F3AECF9F-155D-4519-3EAABFC85829E3CB)
from the typical crowded vantage point, head North instead of South from the parking
lot. Notice the
[trail that heads up to the left of the rise](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5UlZzUDEtTm96c1U).
The trail may disappear for a bit, but just keep scrambling up and in.
If you can see the [rest of the ridge trail](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5TEdVY2l4OFhXdmc),
chances are you are also nearby the [USGS marker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5ejRmM2xoampxeFU).
Always bring work gloves for rock scrambling and for
[directing traffic](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5LWJ0MTRHS3g3TWc).

Rolled up ~11:30am and left ~1pm.

__NOTE__: no toilet at the top car park, but there is a solitary concrete pit
toilet about a mile before the parking area. Plenty of friendly rocks near the
USGS marker.

### Golden Canyon (tourists), Red Cathedral, Gower Gulch (sound of silence)
Pulled into the Golden Canyon parking lot ~1:30pm for eats; probably did
[the drive](https://goo.gl/maps/4ogDW) faster than we should have. Never before
had I seen a selfie-stick in person; almost thought I saw some heels on one woman. WUT?

The gist is to hike up Golden Canyon,
go past the [Gower Gulch/badlands turn-off](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5MHhNb3pneElfMWs)
up to the Red Cathedral,
turn around and head back down
Gower Gulch.
Total time ~2.5 hours: 30-45 minutes up Golden Canyon to the Red Cathedral, 30 minutes
in the badlands, 45 minutes down Gower Gulch, and 15 minutes crossing back to the parking
area from the [Southern outflow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5OWtXeVZOMk03RE0).
There is a good map
at the bottom of the linked _Hikespeak.com_ write-up.

If you want to hear total silence, stop and stand at
[36.4149847,-116.8360711,224m](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4149847,-116.8360711,224m/data=!3m1!1e3),
or in an image:

__NOTE__: [Zabriskie Point](http://www.hikespeak.com/attractions/zabriskie-point-in-death-valley/)
parking and access from the Hwy 190 side is
[closed through March 2015](http://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/zabriskie-point.htm).
Can still get close by hiking through the badlands from the Golden Canyon side.

### Beatty, Nevada
About an [hour drive](https://goo.gl/maps/0ShSp) from Golden Canyon to
[Death Valley Inn](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45919-d1232760-Reviews-Death_Valley_Inn-Beatty_Nevada.html).
Accommodations met expectations. WiFi was good. Communal pool area hot-tub had some windblown
grit; it was very windy after all!

The Dennys as you head NE on Main St/Hwy 95 inside the smokey _StageCoach Hotel & Casino_ was
decent enough for a Christmas Eve; our server was way overwhelmed with tables.
Picked up milk and cereal at the Rebel 74 (gas/kwiky mart) but, did not play the slots.
I like guaranteed winning.
