[White Ranch Park](http://jeffco.us/parks/parks-and-trails/white-ranch-park/)
is on the West side of _CO-93_, North of downtown Golden. Typical to the various
parks in the front range, there is lower elevation semiarid vegetation, with
pine forests at higher/wetter elevations.

My mountain biking mentor and I hit the trail from the parking lot around 9am.
He has technical abilities that I do not, while I have the aerobic endurance;
this tends to balance things out.

From the parking lot, through the wash, to the stream crossing is a light uphill.
Beyond the stream crossing, the Belcher Hill trail is a sustained climb, until
a little bit beyond the Longhorn trail turn-off (see map). We were hoping to go
farther, but my partner tore a hole in his side wall and inner tube
cleaning some rocks in the pine forest. He hiked back down and I looped back
on the Whippletree trail.

Returned to a rather full parking lot around 10:30am.
