Bare CentOS 5.8 install over the weekend. When I mean bare, I mean disabling all
packages in the installer; just linux kernel, init scripts, bash, networking. I had
no idea that this would mean no ACPId ... which meant nothing happened when I
pushed the power button; I do not use that option to often as this is a headless
media server system out of the way in my basement.<br />
<br />
<strong>the fix</strong><br />
<blockquote>
    <code>
        yum install acpid<br />
        vi /etc/acpi/events/power.conf<br />
    </code>
</blockquote>
<br />
<strong>the config file</strong><br />
<blockquote>
    <code>
        # ACPID config to power down machine if powerbutton is pressed, but only if<br />
        # no gnome-power-manager is running<br />
        <br />
        event=button/power.*<br />
        action=/sbin/poweroff<br />
    </code>
</blockquote>
