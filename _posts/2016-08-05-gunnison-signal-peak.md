The name brand mountain bike trail system of Gunnison is definitely
[Hartman Rocks](http://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8011625/hartman-rocks).
When we rolled into town, it was lightly raining.
According to the _Quality Inn_ front-desk staffer, it had been for 1.5 days.
To prevent damaging choice single track, we took to the double track right behind our hotel.

There are all kinds of single and double track trails crossing through the sage brush in the hills behind
_Western State Colorado University_. The _Ridgeline_ trail to _Signal Peak_ is rocky/sandy double track
most of the way, until we had to turn around 300 ft below the summit of _Signal Peak_.
