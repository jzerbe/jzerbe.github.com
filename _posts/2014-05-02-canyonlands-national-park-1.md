Second in a three part series on Arches and Canyonlands trip over May 1-3.

### The Drive
_Advertised_ to take ~[30 minutes](https://goo.gl/maps/EQCqb)
from Moab to the Canyonlands entrance station. I will say this:
I drive faster when there are not any state patrol around and there did not
seem to be any on UT-313; be careful on US-191!
[$10 entrance fee](http://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm),
they accept credit cards; same as Arches.


### Gooseberry Trail
Bypassed the visitor center. Past _The Neck_, there did not seem to be anyone
in the park ~9am. WUT? [15-30 minutes](https://goo.gl/maps/oRYdt) past the
entrance station, you will reach the unmarked picnic area/toilet/parking turn-out.
If you hit the _Grand View Point_ cul-de-sac, go back North and turn-right
at the first turn-out. We were heading (quite literally) down the trail
~9:15am. Looks like a significant drop-off, which it is
(drops 1400 ft in 7/10 of a mile), but it is a very well maintained trail.
__Follow the cairns__. Happened upon one couple, and another pair starting when
we returned ~11:45am. Really people?!? Heat of the day?

- 5.5 miles RT; ~2.5 hours total; 1400 ft elevation change;

Mostly taken on the trek back up.

Popped the windows/doors and lunched in the shade of my car.


### Murphy Point Overlook
Decent views (I am spoiled) of the _Green River_ basin and _White Rim Road_
can be had from the overlook. Hit it from 1-2pm; which was only possible in
full sun because the high must have been mid-70s. Seemed as though more
people access the _White Rim Road_ from the _Murphy Loop_ than where we went
down on _Gooseberry Trail_. Designated parking limited to ~10 parking spots.

- ~3.2 miles RT; 1 hour total; ~50 ft elevation change

### Misc
Hit a few _less tourist flocked_ drive-up overlooks on the way out of the park.
Made 5 minutes for the visitor center and 5 for the toilets and water fill-up.
At this point ~3pm we were so done. The pool felt great ~4pm.


### Moab Brewery
[Moab Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/moab-brewery-moab-2) was right across
from our hotel, and already at ~5:45pm it was getting full. Fortunately my dad
and I were able to snag a table on the less noisy screen? porch. Small order
of plain _Brew Pub Nachos_ + drinks was enough to get us going; I have had
some nacho plates in my day, and this could certainly satisfy one person.
The [unfiltered wheat on tap](http://www.themoabbrewery.com/brewery.html) is solid.
We each got the [Veggie Burrito](http://www.themoabbrewery.com/menu.html),
which is certainly one of the most interesting and filling burritos I have had.

Check it out.
