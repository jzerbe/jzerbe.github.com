I was having trouble with some old CD-RW's that I was installing Debian 5 from the other day, so since the machine's BIOS supported booting from removable disk (usb), I decided on giving that a try.

Much of this is based on the great article - "<em><a href="http://d-i.pascal.at/">Installing Debian Sarge
from a USB memory stick (USB key)</a></em>"Â - by <a href="http://pascal.at/2.html">Pascal Le Bail</a>.

You are going to need a decent Internet connection that you can download the extra Debian packages from, and a BIOS that can boot from a usb disk. This assumes that your usb disk is the first that you have connected. Run <code>dmesg</code> to find out the exact <code>dev</code> name of your device if <code>sda</code> is incorrect.
<blockquote><code>fdisk /dev/sda
mkfs -t vfat /dev/sda1
wget http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/lenny/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz
zcat boot.img.gz &gt;/dev/sda1
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cp [netinstall or biz card].iso /mnt/
</code></blockquote>
You can pick up a business card or netinstall cd iso from <em><a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst">Installing Debian GNU/Linux via the Internet</a></em>.
