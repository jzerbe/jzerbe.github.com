I just starting working with what the developer community calls <a title="Wikipedia: English: Ajax" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" target="_blank"><em>AJax</em></a> about four months ago. Now I'm working on a massive database driven portal with a huge amount AJax calls to backend PHP scripts. I had the PHP down, but I needed to learn AJax fast. How did I do it? It only took about an hour of Javascript brush-up work and another hour of reading and working with the two following tutorials.

My first really helpful encounter with the concept of AJax was the <a href="http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html" target="_blank"><em>Ajax and XMLHttpRequest Tutorial</em></a> which includes a step by step source code representation of the process to making the necessary asynchronous Javascript requests. The second tutorial that I suggest is Dynamic Drive's <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/ajaxroutine.htm" target="_blank">Basic Ajax Routine (Get &amp; Post)</a>, which includes many source code and running examples, plus downloadable fully functioning scripts.

If you have a basic knowledge of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/JS/" target="_blank">Javascript</a> and PHP (or some other server-side scripting language) you are ready to go implement some AJax after reading through these two tutorials.
