This is an extension of my previously published [elevation-agnostic-cornbread](http://jzerbe.com/2013/11/elevation-agnostic-cornbread/).
The spicing is different and the prep is a little longer, but the reward is well worth it!

I was out earlier in the week for [dinner at Brazen Neighborhood Eatery](http://brazendenver.com/menu/dinner/).
Currently on the menu is _Jamaican Jerk Chicken_ with _bourbon cornbread_ and _tomatillo salad_. The flavors worked
so well together and I had this crazy idea that I might be able to layer some of those flavors together into my
cornbread for a cocktail party later that week.

What you end up with is a cornbread that is savory, contains aromatics like Christmas cookies, and has tremendous moisture content.
