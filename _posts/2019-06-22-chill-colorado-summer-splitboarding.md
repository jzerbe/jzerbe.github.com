Why deal with crowds on the East side of Berthoud Pass when there are some great lap-able
wind loaded powder stashes on the West side? Obviously do not attempt during winter,
but come early summer this makes for great riding.

### West Guanella Pass

Some great wind loading during the winter to keep this East facing slope going into early June.
Threading the ridgeline on the way up for a wide-open cruise-y descent.

### Loveland Ski Area

Loveland Ski Area has a [very welcoming uphill policy](https://skiloveland.com/the-mountain/uphill-access/)
to begin with. After they closed for the winter season, there were several more great storms that rolled
through this East facing area with predominantly low avalanche danger.
End of June for this particular track.

Stay away from the headwalls on the South end of the bowl and you will be fine.
