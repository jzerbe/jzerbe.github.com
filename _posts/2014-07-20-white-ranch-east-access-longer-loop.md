I previously wrote about White Ranch in:
[White Ranch East access short course loop](http://vraidsys.com/2014/06/white-ranch-east-access-short-course-loop/).

Nothing but downhill on the return from the linked longer run.

__Update__ August 10: Highly suggest starting by 8am to
beat most of the other foot/bike/equestrian traffic.
