Recently my dell inspiron 1501's battery has been acting up. The problem started out
with the BIOS spurting out an error message at bootup, which I though was merely a glitch:<br />
<br />
<code>WARNING: The battery cannot be identified.
    This system will be unable to charge this battery.
    Press Any Key to Continue
    Press  2 times to enter SETUP
    Press  and Any Key to enter Boot Menu</code><br />
<br />
I figured I could fix this up with a quick
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;releaseid=R174470&amp;SystemID=INS_PNT_1501&amp;servicetag=&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;deviceid=13120&amp;devlib=0&amp;typecnt=0&amp;vercnt=9&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=1&amp;fileid=236967">update to the Phoenix BIOS (via a Windows utility)</a>
which my laptop was in need of. Remember kiddies, when flashing your BIOS, follow all the
instructions or live in fear of creating a fancy paper-weight.<br />
<br />
So I updated the BIOS to version 2.6.3. No more battery error messages, but my PC was
still acting up. The battery wouldn't hold charge and XP (32bit and 64bit) would be unresponsive
to my keyboard and mouse clicks/movements while the battery was installed. I decided to pop out
the battery and see if it would run faster, which it did.<br />
<br />
All in all, the battery just was getting old and would no longer hold charge. I thought that my
battery might last more than a year, since I had been keeping to
