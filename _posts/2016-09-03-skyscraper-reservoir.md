At just over an hour drive from my place in East Golden, I am really surprised at how few people (4) I ran into while
on the single track once in the wilderness area. An absolutely beautiful late summer day to do this trek.
Do not do this any earlier in the season as a couple of the forest and meadow areas would be too mucky.
To get decent parking be sure to show up before 8am.
