After some searching around on the Google machine, I came across "<a href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl/">Linux wireless LAN support</a>". It's one of the most complete directories I've seen for a very long time. I had a suspicion that my DWL-G510 pci card might work, as it is old enough and I've read about other similar models of D-Link card being supported natively. It turns out that mine works seamlessly with stuff from the <a href="http://madwifi-project.org/">MadWifi project</a>. Because I was feeling lazy and wanted a tried and true install method, I found "<em><a href="http://www.sumardi.net/2007/06/21/how-to-install-madwifi-on-debian-40-etch/">How To Install MadWifi On Debian 4.0 (Etch)</a></em>" by <a href="http://www.sumardi.net/about/">Sumardi Shukor</a>. The following is based on the article on his blog.
<blockquote><code>vi /etc/apt/source.list</code> [add "contrib non-free" after "main" to the various lines]
<code>apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential module-assistant wireless-tools
module-assistant
module-assistant auto-install madwifi-source
modprobe ath_pci
ifconfig ath0 up [bring up the wireless interface]
iwlist ath0 scanning [scan for a wireless network to connect to]</code></blockquote>
I suggest using a GUI app to do the rest, such as <a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">wicd</a>.
