After some searching around on the Google machine, I came across
"<a href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl/">Linux wireless LAN support</a>". It's one of the most complete
directories I've seen for a very long time. I had a suspicion that my DWL-G510 pci card might work,
as it is old enough and I've read about other similar models of D-Link card being supported natively.
It turns out that mine works seamlessly with stuff from the <a href="http://madwifi-project.org/">MadWifi project</a>.
Because I was feeling lazy and wanted a tried and true install method, I found
"<em><a href="http://www.sumardi.net/2007/06/21/how-to-install-madwifi-on-debian-40-etch/">How To Install MadWifi On Debian 4.0 (Etch)</a></em>"
by <a href="http://www.sumardi.net/about/">Sumardi Shukor</a>. The following is based on the article on his blog.
<blockquote><code>vi /etc/apt/source.list</code> [add "contrib non-free" after "main" to the various lines]<br />
    <code>apt-get update<br />
        apt-get install build-essential module-assistant wireless-tools<br />
        module-assistant<br />
        module-assistant auto-install madwifi-source<br />
        modprobe ath_pci<br />
        ifconfig ath0 up</code> [bring up the wireless interface]<br />
    <code>iwlist ath0 scanning</code> [scan for a wireless network to connect to]</blockquote>
I suggest using a GUI app to do the rest, such as <a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">wicd</a>.
