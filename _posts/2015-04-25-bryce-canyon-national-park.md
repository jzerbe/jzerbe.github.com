This is the third of three days spent in Southwest Utah.
The weather was cool and damp enough for a fast pace and kept most eveyone else in bed.
There was ice on our rental car when we got up in the morning!

### Morning commute
The drive [from Bryce View Lodge to Fairyland Point](https://goo.gl/maps/84thT)
is one of the shortest trailhead drives I have ever done. You do not even have
to go through the main park entrance; the trailhead is before that! I just left
my parks pass on the dash. In any case, when we rolled through the
entrance/fee station ~7:45am, no one was collecting and we were able to drive
in and grab some literature from the baskets outside the locked visitor center.

### Fairyland Loop

### Eats and sleeps
On the drive
[from the visitor center to the La Quinta in South Vegas](https://goo.gl/maps/eQ909)
we must have went through at least three biomes: alpine, forest, and high/low desert.
I had to get some pics of the spring pow dumps that
[OpenSnow](http://opensnow.com/state/UT) correctly predicted:

Good stuff from Yelp: [The Great Greek](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-great-greek-henderson).
[15 minute drive from our hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/sS6Dj);
short compared to all the driving earlier in the weekend.
I had the _Mezze Plate_ and my dad had the _Grilled Salmon Rice Bowl_ from
[the menu](http://thegreatgreekgrill.com/menu.html).
