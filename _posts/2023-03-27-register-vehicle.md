The best spots in North America to register a vehicle by odd fringe benefits.

### Canada
- __British Columbia__: Previously held the title for the lowest car registration fees in Canada coming in at
[$40-100/year](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.irponline.org/resource/resmgr/fee_schedules/bc_feechart_11.29.12.pdf).
- __Ontario__: As of March 13 2023 the
[cost for registering](https://www.ontario.ca/page/driver-and-vehicle-fees) a passenger vehicle is __$0__. You still have to file yearly online renewals.

### United States
- __Alaska__: Permanent registration (pay one fee and never again) of
[passenger vehicles 8 years or older in participating boroughs](http://doa.alaska.gov/dmv/reg/Perm_Reg.htm).
On top of a $3k (for 2022) [Permanent Fund Dividend for being a resident](https://pfd.alaska.gov/).
- __Montana__: Permanent registration (pay one fee and never again) of
[passenger vehicles 11 years or older state-wide](https://dojmt.gov/driving/vehicle-title-and-registration/#lightvehiclepr).

[low registration fees](https://leg.mt.gov/content/publications/fiscal/2023-Interim/Aug-2021/Vehicle-Fee-Brochure.pdf),
especially in Flathead County.

### Central America
