Over the past day or so, I have been doing some update/maintenance work on the
<a href="http://www.rewardchamp.com/offers/detail/27/153">I Am Super Rich MySpace application</a>
for <a href="http://www.solitechgmbh.com/">Solitech GmbH</a>. (You can also find its Facebook
counterpart under the name <a href="http://www.rewardchamp.com/offers/detail/26/153">I Am Rich</a>.)
I've done work on these application before, and have had success in picking up the code really quick,
but I now have to transition the MySpace edition over the OpenSocial 0.8 to get the application to
post on users' event feeds. The (now old) <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/Technical-Resources/opensocial-spec-v08.html">0.8 OpenSocial spec</a>
was <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2009/01/08/what-s-new-in-myspace-opensocial-0-8.aspx">released sometime in January 2009 on MySpace</a>,
and update from the really old <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/Technical-Resources/opensocial-spec-v07.html">0.7 OpenSocail spec</a>.
Along with the 0.8 release on MySpace came the
<a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2008/11/21/beta-release-of-the-myspace-custom-application-activities.aspx">opening of Activity Feed functionality to 3rd party developers</a>.<br />
<br />
Here is what is required to get Applications posting to users' event feeds:
<ol>
    <li>your MySpace app must be running in the 0.8 OpenSocial framework</li>
    <li>MySpace app must make use of the <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/community/myspace/activities.aspx">templating engine for Activies</a></li>
    <li>MySpace app must not be using old/deprecated 0.7 OpenSocial Javascript. This was a real problem for
        the IMSR app ... had to hunt through several hundred lines of Javascript. Check out this seriously helpful
        <a href="http://wiki.developer.myspace.com/index.php?title=What's_New_in_MySpace_OpenSocial_0.8_-_Part_1">MySpace developer wiki entry on transitioning your app to 0.8</a>.</li>
</ol>
