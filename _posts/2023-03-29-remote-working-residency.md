As an employee, you generally don't have to worry about government paperwork and compliance filings.
Maybe a few hours at tax time, but nothing compared to your employer.

You may receive notices from your employer like - "you may work internationally for up to one month" or "as long 
as you stay within your original employment state" - this is because permanently moving or working in different 
province, state, or country for an extended time is a big compliance headache for your employer.

If an employer has a permanent employee in a region, the employer will have to create a local entity or utilize 
the services of an [Employer of Record](https://boundlesshq.com/blog/employment/what-is-an-employer-of-record/)
to be in compliance with government regulations because of you, the employee.

My suggestion: use a virtual mailbox service to make things easy for your employer by maintaining an address 
in your original employment location. Services like [Anytime Mailbox]({{ site.program.business.anytimemb }}),
[iPostal1]({{ site.program.business.ipostal1 }}), USPS PO Boxes with
[informed delivery](https://www.usps.com/manage/informed-delivery.htm) +
[real street address](https://postalpro.usps.com/PBSA) - can be used depending
on how you plan to remote work. Just be sure that your 
final address isn't flagged as a [Commercial Mailing Receiving Agency](https://www.smarty.com/docs/cmra)
using the [USPS's address lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?byaddress) if using a US address.
