[Mount Falcon Park](http://jeffco.us/parks/parks-and-trails/mount-falcon-park/)
is to the Southwest of Morrison, North of US-285. This is a pretty good
representation of what you will see at other [Front Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range)
parks: semi-arid vegetation, giving way to pine forest at higher elevation.

I convinced my biking partner to start from the East parking lot, or rather the
parking lot for _Morrison Town Park_. This way, we could maximize our sweating
by having ~1500ft of elevation change in 3 miles. On the _Castle Trail_, there are
two larger rock fields where I had to get off and walk, and 5-10 times where
I had to dismount for a tight switchback. Just keep in mind that the downhill
will be worth it!

Continue on the _Castle Trail_ until right before the West parking lot. Take a
hard left at the
[pit toilet and log fence remnant](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6356725,-105.2374338,96m/data=!3m1!1e3).
Once on the singletrack _Parmalee Trail_ there is ~500ft of elevation change where the trail
descends and then ascends back to the _Meadow Trail_ that runs the ridge-line.
_Meadow Trail_ connects back with _Castle Trail_ to form a "lollipop".

I arrived at the East parking lot a bit before 8:30am, and snagged a spot
that had just opened up. Otherwise there were openings a few cars down Vine St.
By the time we returned ~11:30am, it was packed out with 30 some cars out the
lot and down the street. Had lunch at
[TNT Country Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tnt-country-kitchen-morrison).
Huevos racheros never tasted so good; probably because I was quite hungry.
