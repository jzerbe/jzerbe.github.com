This would have been a perfect ride, aside from me being stupid and breaking my bike.
Well, not breaking, but denting in one of the rear struts enough to make the rear
disc and caliper assembly drag. $500 29er with an aluminum frame, means it is
done. At least it was on the downhill in the last third of the loop.

It took my partner and I 45 minutes to come up from Highlands Ranch via the
[Morrison route](https://goo.gl/maps/1dr04). We returned the same way and stopped
in at the [TNT Country Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tnt-country-kitchen-morrison),
which I would highly suggest.


### Timetable ###
- 8:15am start from the
[Sleepy S trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6631307,-105.3584035,105m/data=!3m1!1e3)
- 10:35am summit
- 11:50am return to car

The first three trail photos are at the first South overlook on
_Meadow View trail_ after switchbacking up through pine and aspen. The last
four photos are looking North off Bergen Peak. Do not be dissuaded from heading
up _Bergen Peak trail_, it looks rocky at the trail junction with
_Meadow View trail_, which it is, but those are pretty much the only noticeable
rocks you will encounter on the trip to the peak.
