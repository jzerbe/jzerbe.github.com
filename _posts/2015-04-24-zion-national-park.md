This is the second of three days spent in Southwest Utah.
The level of riff-raff in Zion is higher than I expected for this time of year.

### Morning commute
The drive [from Hurricane to the Zion visitor center](https://goo.gl/maps/ACQKm) was uneventful.

At the South/Springdale entrance we had a 10 minute wait ~8am with only one of the windows running.
I purchased an [$80 annual pass](http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/annual-passes.htm),
as Zion is [$25](http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm)
and Bryce (next day) is another [$25](http://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fees.htm),
plus I will probably end up in Rocky Mountain NP some time this summer -
[$20](http://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/fees.htm) - and Canyonlands in the fall -
[$10](http://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/fees.htm).

Got a close-in spot at the visitor center, filled up our water, and got on the
[shuttle](http://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/shuttlesystem.cfm)
for the 7th stop: _Weeping Rock_. Everyone on the shuttle except for us
got off at the 6th stop, _The Grotto_, for what I am assuming was their attempt
at [_Angels Landing_](http://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/angelslanding.cfm).
Great! Less people to be noisy; ah, the joys of shared resources.

### Observation Point
Point forecast for peak: [5 Miles NNE Zion NP & Zion Canyon UT](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.2809165&lon=-112.9390522)

Full disclosure, my dad suggested
[_Observation Point_](http://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/obspoint.cfm)
as an alternative to _Angels Landing_, and I am quite glad he did.

1. 8:30am: start from TH
2. 10:15am: summit
3. 10:20am: watch two falcons ride thermals right past my face
4. 10:30am: 6 more people show up and commence with the loud talking.
The Germans I will give a pass, but the Colorado folk should know better.
5. 10:45am: leave summit
6. 11:55am: reach edge of maintained [_Hidden Canyon_](http://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/hiddencanyon.cfm) trail
7. 12:05pm: leave Hidden Canyon
8. 12:20pm: start into lunch at _Weeping Rock_ TH benches

8+1.5 miles/2100+600ft RT in ~4 hours

### Riverside Walk
After lunch we figured we should spend some more time in the park.
I wanted to see what _The Narrows_ is all about. Took the shuttle to the
last/farthest North stop, Temple of Sinawava, and braved the crowds.
Well probably not as crowded as peak season, but my dad and I were fast walking,
which meant dodging strollers, land-waddlers, riff-raff, etc.

Spent an hour on that. I am pretty sure I do not need to do _The Narrows_;
walking in a cold-water canyon seeing much of the same. Nah.

### Emerald Pools
Coming South, we stopped at _The Grotto_ shuttle stop and took the _Kayenta Trail_ in;
less riff-raff that way. First hit the middle, then upper, and finally lower.
None were particularly __emerald__ in color. The upper was actually __brown__.

Spent 1.5 hours on that. Meh. Spoiled after the grand _Observation Point_ experience.

before crossing over to _Zion Lodge_ shuttle stop.

### Eats and sleeps
The drive [from the visitor center to Bryce View Lodge](https://goo.gl/maps/8SxRI)
had plenty of high-alpine grasslands to look at once into Garfield county.
Uneventful? Fortunately we only had a 10 minute wait to get through the
[Mount Carmel Tunnel](http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/the-zion-mount-carmel-tunnel.htm)
~4pm.

Another solid Yelp find: [Cafe Adobe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/adobe-deli-hatch).
Even though it is the only place for miles around that serves more than
burgers and steak, I would probably stop off even if there were other options.
The chile relleno and tamale I ordered were on point. The service was perfect.
Stopped in ~5pm and left a bit before 6pm. Right along the way in Hatch.
No beer; not sure if the Mormon temple across the street has anything to do with this?
Chocolate shake was good.

[Bryce View Lodge](http://www.bryceviewlodge.com/) is probably the cheapest
non-camping option as close to the Bryce Canyon park entrance as you are going to get.
Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible. For us just a place to shower and
hang-out until going to sleep.
