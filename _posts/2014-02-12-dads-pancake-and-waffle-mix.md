I picked up this recipe from my Dad, who I pretty sure got it from his mom.
In any case, it works for cooking into pancakes or waffles (using a waffle maker).
Typically the following recipe gets doubled so I have leftovers to freeze.
When doubled the recipe should produce enough to feed 4-6 comfortably.

###Dry Ingredients
- `2 cups` flour
- `2 Tbs` sugar
- `0.5 tsp` salt
- `1 tsp` baking soda
- `1 tsp` baking powder

###Wet Ingredients
- `2 Tbs` oil
- `2` eggs
- `2 cups` milk

###Process
1. Mix up dry ingredients.
2. Create bowl in center of dry ingredients and mix together wet ingredients.
3. Mix dry and wet ingredients until there are no nodules of dry greater than a dime.
4. Dollop appropriately sized amounts of batter into iron or pan.
I typically set pan heat to medium-high and flip when half the bubbles have popped.
