Jackson Hole has the kind of in your face big terrain that I came to expect from my time at [Whistler Blackcomb](http://jzerbe.com/2018/01/whistler-blackcomb/).
Maybe even more in your face. Cliffs and serious steeps will just pop up if you do not know the mountain;
my first two days of riding were very cautious, getting to know the mountain.

### The snowboarding destination
At ~4k ft of vertical drop, there can be plenty of variation in conditions. The days we were on mountain, it paid to stay
[10-15 degrees warmer by being at mid-mountain](https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Jackson-Hole/6day/mid) or higher.

At the Western boundary of the resort, looking toward the tram:

### Getting there
United flies direct Denver to Jackson and they have a great
[Sports equipment](https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/travel/baggage/sports.aspx?POS=US) policy for
_Ski and snowboard equipment_:

> Up to two snowboards in one bag and one snow boot bag

> If the combined weight of the ski bag and boot bag is over 50 pounds (23 kg), applicable overweight charges apply.

In reality as long as you have a snowboard bag that is not over 50 pounds, they don't really care.
On top of that, I run the [United MileagePlus Explorer Business Card](https://creditcards.chase.com/small-business-credit-cards/united-mileageplus-explorer-business),
so I have not had to pay checked bag fees ... ever.

Next time I go to Jackson, I will drive. Flying to/from the Jackson airport is very much rolling the dice whether
your flight will be cancelled. United cancelled our return flight, but was good enough to get us a full refund.
They cancelled the next two day's flights as well. We were able to snag a 2018 Tahoe and make it back to Denver late.

### Lodging
Booked a spot 5 months in advance in Teton Village for $610/night total: [Rendezvous - 2BR Condo #A-3](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7260419).
I could ride all the way from the top of the tram to 30 feet from our front door for almost a mile vertical drop.

Booking that far in advance and in a moderate El Nino year is an exercise in luck.
[Early Feburary is usually snowy](https://www.snowpak.com/wyoming/jackson-hole/snow). We had 1 true powder day,
but with some in-bounds hiking I made fresh knee-deep tracks every day!

### Eating out
[Gather](https://gatherjh.com/menu/) has an adventurous, yet traditional menu. Be warned, getting in to Jackson
for a 6pm dinner reservation on the [$3/person bus](https://www.jacksonwy.gov/404/Schedules) can be tight during rush hour,
allocate at least 1.5 hours if coming from Teton Village.

[Spur Restaurant & Bar](https://www.tetonlodge.com/spur-restaurant.aspx) has a cozy atmosphere and a traditional menu.
Our group favorite just because of the quality of each menu item and the convenience from our condo.

[Teton Thai](https://tetonthaivillage.com/menu) has a tiny dining room and you probably will not make it in.
The clutch play is to order take-out. I did not expect this level of flavorful in Teton Village.

[San Juan Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/2LDy5NNrC1H2) has some properly gigantic and delicious tortas. Will return.
