<strong>NOTE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonzerbe/status/182675503294070784">
    no more free T-Mobile web service with keyword hole</a>.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say that before any of you on AT&amp;T, Verizon, Virgin, or other (excessively over-priced)
mobile transit providers get excited, that <strong>I have just tested this on T-Mobile</strong>
(less over-priced), I'm not sure how the "other guys" do it, but I would be curious to know if they have a similar
opening that works by inserting keywords into URLs.<br />
<strong>Edit July 13 2011</strong>: While traveling around the Midwest this summer, I was able to continue
to get free web-access with my T-Mobile SIM while roaming on AT&amp;T/Cingular (Northern Minnesota and North/South Dakota),
and Rogers Wireless (Manitoba).<br />
<br />
That said, this is a reasonably easy hack conceptually, but there are a few odd things that I had
no idea if they would work or not; until it worked (tested on my Motorola V195S and Razr V3).<br />
<strong>Edit July 13 2011</strong>: This process outlines creating a patched version of
<a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a> for <em>J2ME capable mobile devices</em>.
<ol>
    <li>jar files are essentially solid zip archives [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)">JAR (file format)</a>],
        which can be "unzipped" using just about any archiving utilityy; I use <a href="http://www.peazip.org/">PeaZip</a>.</li>
    <li>Download the original Opera Mini jar: <a href="http://mini.opera.com/download-4/opera-mini-latest-advanced-en-us.jar?no_redir&amp;ismobile=false">http://mini.opera.com/download-4/opera-mini-latest-advanced-en-us.jar?no_redir&amp;ismobile=false</a></li>
    <li>Once you unzip the jar file (probably going to want to move the jar file into a new directory), you should
        now have a bunch of files along with the original jar file. DON'T OPEN ANY OF THE FILES WITH ANY OLD EDITOR,
        IT WILL SCREW UP THE FILE FORMATTING. I mention this, because I fell into this trap trying to edit h.class with vi.</li>
    <li>Using a hex editor, I suggest <a href="http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>. Open up h.class.</li>
    <li>Search and replace the string "server4.operamini.com" with "tmobile4.vraidsys.com". Save your changes and close up your hex editor.
        <strong>Edit August 6 2011</strong>: "tmobile4.vraidsys.com" is a CNAME that points to "server4.operamini.com"
        so that one can make it appear as if the Opera Mini thin client is making backend calls to a tmobile service.
        I also had to add a "tmobile4-1.vraidsys.com" CNAME to my DNS records pointing to "server4.operamini.com" so
        that the initial install of Opera Mini would work correctly.</li>
    <li>Now, open up a terminal/command line window and issue the command <code>jar -uf opera-mini-4-advanced-en-us.jar h.class</code> to
        update the original archive with the modified class file. If you get a command not found error, you might have to do some
        digging. My system did not have the jar command in the system path from the jdk package I use, either.</li>
    <li>Optional: create a new kickass i.png file to use as the icon instead of the default Opera logo. Keep it 15 by 15 pixels.</li>
    <li>Transfer the jar onto your mobile device and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
