Previously did
[Mt. Sherman from the West](http://vraidsys.com/2013/07/mt.-sherman-west-slopes-from-iowa-gulch/)
(Leadville) side. Had not done any 14ers yet this season,
and needed to retrain my muscle memory.
This is a great 14er route to get started with: 2 hour drive on 285 from Denver,
unlike the West side there is no muck dodging, and only 1 false summit.
Of the two hour drive, the last 30 minutes is on a dirt access road
that can be done by even a Honda Accord (saw it with my own eyes).

###Timetable###
- 8:20am start via _Fourmile Creek_ trailhead
- 9:20am summit Sherman
- 10:30am summit Sheridan
- 11:10am return to saddle
- 11:40am return to car

I always wear work gloves. The last mile to the summit of Sherman
has some exposure that gloves are useful in handling.
