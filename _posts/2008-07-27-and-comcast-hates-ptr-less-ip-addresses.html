Surprising, never knew that <a href="http://www.comcast.net/">Comcast</a> filters out email from IP addresses without <a href="http://aplawrence.com/Blog/B961.html">PTR records</a>. I mean I am able to setup <a href="http://www.openspf.org/">SPF records</a>, but that's about it, unless I lease another VPS or dedicated box and setup my own dns servers so I can run domain keys.
<blockquote><code>Connected to 76.96.62.116 but greeting failed.
Remote host said: 554 IMTA22.westchester.pa.mail.comcast.net comcast 65.254.216.210 Comcast requires that all mail servers must have a PTR record with a valid Reverse DNS entry. Currently your mail server does not fill that requirement. For more information, refer to: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp?faq=SecurityMail_Policy18784">http://www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp?faq=SecurityMail_Policy18784</a>
I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.</code></blockquote>
Well that sucks, I just sent off a notice to the <a href="http://www.amerihosting.com/">Amerihosting guys</a>. I wonder what they'll think? I nabbed <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Networking/Protocols/DNS/Q_22811238.html">the following off of experts-exchange.com</a> (excerpt from the user called <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/M_3571763.html">bluetab</a>). (Did you know that if you are using Firefox on experts-exchange.com you don't have to register or pay? You can just scroll to the bottom and read the answers.)
<blockquote>I used <span class="searchTerm">zoneedit</span> to <span class="searchTerm">create</span> RDNS <span class="searchTerm">records</span> for my IP address block and it worked great.  It was just a pain to get it setup.
We <span class="searchTerm">created</span> a <span class="searchTerm">record</span> in <span class="searchTerm">ZoneEdit</span>.  The IP block has to be formatted as such: XX.XXX.XXX.XXX-XX where the -XX represents the subnet masks /29 for example.  After <span class="searchTerm">ZoneEdit</span> assigned us name servers we had to send a request back to ATT (our T1 provider).  The email basically told ATT to change the nameservers for our IP block.
"We are requesting a change for reverse DNS zone delegation.
Please change the DNS servers for DSE IP block XX.XXX.XXX.XXX-XX on Circuit ID DHEC-XXXXXX to:
ns12.zoneedit.com
ns14.zoneedit.com"</blockquote>
So it can be done! I just hope it works with a single IPv4 address ...
