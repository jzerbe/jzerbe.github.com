This was an ambitious 6 night, 5.5 day, 2600 mi driving trip with mountain biking in a different city every day.
I had to take a few day break from mountain biking after this one!

Below is a detailed map of where we stopped for biking, eats, drinks, gas, and sleeps.
I would recommend every place we stopped except for the Rainbow Point campground because of mosquitoes,
although lake in MT ... this is to be expected.
