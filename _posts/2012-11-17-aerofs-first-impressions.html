Check out <a href="https://www.aerofs.com/">AeroFS</a> ASAP! May require a few
business days to get an invite code, but eventually you will recieve an
automated email from an account administered by

It has made my LAN sync work-flow much easier. Nor are you just constrained to
the LAN:

<strong>environment</strong><br />
When I am home, I plug my various machines in to my 1Gbps Ethernet switch.
Up until a few weeks ago, I had an elaborate system of mouse-clicks and scripts
to curmudgen SFTP synching with my NAS and periodically push back-ups to
an external hard-drive. Painful. I only had 0.5GB of my 50GB of content
auto-magically synching with Dropbox. I really do not want to be synching 50GB
(and growing) of content across the crappy DSL line I am on.<br />
<br />

<strong>AeroFS NAS set-up</strong><br />
I am running this on CentOS release 5.8 (Final). Pick up the tarball from
<a href="https://www.aerofs.com/download?os=linux">https://www.aerofs.com/download?os=linux</a>.
<blockquote>
    <code>
        yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk sharutils procps screen<br />
        screen -dmS AeroFS /srv/AeroFS_bin/aerofs-cli<br />
    </code><br />
    I added the <code>screen</code> line to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> so it
    always runs on start-up. Not the best practice, but it works.

<strong>annoyances</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>fight with Windows install to periodically re-remove AeroFS from start-up</li>
    <li>slow sync: 2-4MB/sec compared to the sustained 10MB/sec I can easily get with SFTP</li>
    <li>no total transfer ETA</li>
    <li>does not play with my 500GB NTFS volume via autofs. something about no FUSE support.</li>
</ul>
