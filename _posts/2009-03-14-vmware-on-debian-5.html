This will get vmware workstation going on your Debian 5 box.

add "contrib non-free" after "main" to the various lines in your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file

before running the vmware installer, do some dependency installs: <code>apt-get install gcc g++ make perl psmisc linux-headers-`uname -r`</code>

download from: <a href="https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/p/download.php?p=workstation-l">https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/p/download.php?p=workstation-l</a>. login or register then select your download. I suggest installing via the rpm, in which case: <code>apt-get install alien</code>.

converting the rpm to a deb takes about 15 minutes, but it is easier than installing from a tarball (.tar.gz).
<code>alien --to-deb --scripts [vmware-rpm-name].rpm</code>
after about 1-5 minutes should output a deb file
at which point run the command: <code>dpkg -i [vmware-pkg-name].deb</code>
take another 5-10 minutes to install all the files

start via vmware command, be sure to be connected via <a title="Debian 5 multi-user VNC" href="http://vraidsys.com/2009/02/debian-5-multi-user-vnc/">vnc</a>Â or in some sort of X-Window environment.
