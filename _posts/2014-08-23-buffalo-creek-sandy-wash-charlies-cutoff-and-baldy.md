Buffalo Creek is a massive openspace area. At only an hour from my place,
I am shocked I had not been here sooner. Will have to thank my latest
trail partner for the suggestion ... again. We started ~8:15am from
the 1/5 full trailhead parking and returned ~10:30am to full parking. Only started
running into other bikers (or anyone at all) on the Baldy downslope.

As one of the reviews on
[singletracks](http://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/buffalo-creek.html)
says, "The biggest and best system I've ridden so far".

Be sure to bring a map. I put the super-size map from
[Front Range Mountain Bike Patrol](http://www.frmbp.org/maps.html)
on my local
[GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvdzlWemFkc2ZjSVk/edit?usp=sharing)
prior. The 2013 USGS Southern section of the 
[Pine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvaGdrbjRlMlNlZnc/edit?usp=sharing),
and the Northern section of the
[Green Mountain](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvYk1MN211UEYyeDg/edit?usp=sharing)
quadrangle topographical maps were a bit cluttered for my purposes.
You really do not change more than a thousand feet over the whole loop.
Going counter-clockwise, it is all down hill once you are on 727 - Baldy.

I had no problems on my stock hard-tail 29er. I expect to be back for several more rounds.
