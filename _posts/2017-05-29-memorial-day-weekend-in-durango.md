Went with a good crew to Durango over Memorial Day weekend. This is a trip summary for repeatability purposes.
Such a good trip!

The AirBnb North of town was gorgeous, but a little too far out of town for my tastes: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5836235

## Friday May 26
Leave Boulder ~4pm, for an arrival ~10:30/11pm at the AirBnb.
Check in was not until after 3pm anyways.
Packed in some groceries for Saturday breakfast.

## Saturday May 27
The breakfast nook at the AirBnb was pretty fantastic:

Pick up rental bike after 9am at [2nd Ave Sports](https://www.yelp.com/biz/second-avenue-sports-durango). Had to make the reservation 1.5 weeks in advance.

Drove 1.5 hours to [Phil's World Parking Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/paJ3qPJNDWF2).
Rode about half of <https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/621788/phils-world> including <https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/4537895/hippie-house> (my favorite) and <https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/4538948/stinking-springs>.
Lunched so hard after that in the parking lot.

Drinks at [Ska Brewing Co](https://goo.gl/maps/TSovLoE18Eu).

Dinner at [Carver Brewing Co](https://goo.gl/maps/zR2Kr2boVh62).

## Sunday May 28
Great morning ride right from in town at [Horse Gulch](http://www.durangogov.org/Facilities/Facility/Details/13); the [E 3rd St parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/c2SxWzYxT752) has limited spaces.
Great documentation by locals to plan your day: https://www.trails2000.org/trails/horse-gulch/

Dinner at [Seasons of Durango](https://goo.gl/maps/azNW4DDtoTy) for date night was spectacular.

## Monday May 29
Parked in front of [199 Ella Vita Ct](https://goo.gl/maps/AmEZRVd4Yx72) for the _Spirit Trail_.
Went for a quick ride up and down <https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/5683296/ella-vita>
to get the jimmys out before driving back to Denver.
