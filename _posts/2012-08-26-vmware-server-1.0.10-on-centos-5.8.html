I am running old x86 hardware and the disk drivers for CentOS 6 just do not jive
with my setup. I would use Debian, but the install process for VMware Server
is janky on non-RHEL. I want to run Windows XP and various Linux distros with as
little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">hypervisor</a> overhead
as possible. This means I have been choosing VMware Server 1.0.10
(<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=33920&forum=56#forumpost145817">EOL</a>)
for the past few years. Unlike the version 2 RAM-hog, the last release of version 1 continues
to work great for my purposes. VMware no longer links to the download page from
their search results or site nav, but fortunately I have kept it bookmarked:

<strong>setup on a minimal CentOS 5.8 install</strong><br />
The following should install the necessary build tools and development file
dependencies needed to create the various VMware Server binaries. 25MB via yum.<br />
<blockquote>
    <code>
        yum install make gcc kernel-devel xinetd<br />
        yum groupinstall 'X Software Development'<br />
    </code>
</blockquote>
<br />
<strong>the install pastie</strong><br />
Download (102MB), extract, install ... configure. The install Perl script should
automatically redirect you to the installed vmware-config.pl; defaults should be
fine for the install and config scripts.<br />
Linux version 1.0.10 serial number: 98RD1-Y6HD9-2FH65-4KLUH<br />
<blockquote>
    <code>
        wget <a href="http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmserver/VMware-server-1.0.10-203137.tar.gz">http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmserver/VMware-server-1.0.10-203137.tar.gz</a><br />
        tar xzvf VMware-server-1.0.10-203137.tar.gz<br />
