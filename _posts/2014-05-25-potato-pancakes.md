Fried potato and onion? Hard to go wrong with that. I like to serve with
cheese, hot salsa, and applesauce. Makes 6-8 pancakes.

### Ingredients
- `2.5 cups` grated potato. approximately 2 large russet potatoes.
- `2 Tbs` flour
- `1 cup` chopped onion
- 2 eggs
- `1/8 tsp` pepper

### Process
1. Beat eggs until uniformly yellow.
2. Mix egg, flour, onion, and pepper together.
3. Peel and grate potatoes. Have your cook surface ready to go
to prevent too much batter discoloration.
4. Mix all ingredients together and spoon out palm? size circles onto pan.
5. Cook on medium-high heat until there appears to be a thin layer of canned
tuna on the top (~5 minutes), then flip and cook other side for 3-5 minutes.
