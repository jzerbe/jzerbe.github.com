This was another _substitute trail_ over the weekend. This trail was still
pretty good, but not quite as much oomph as what we had planned to do:
[San Jacinto Peak via Palm Springs Tram](http://www.localhikes.com/Hikes/SanJacintoPeak_4472.asp).
Did not do my due dillegence on this front: called up the night before to find
out that from Long Valley it would be hardpack snow on trail and post-holing off trail.

In any case, we encountered some drifts at the _Saddle Junction_
(with the Pacific Crest Trail) and above, but still very passable with hiking boots.

### Timetable
- 11:35am start from the trailhead parking lot.
- 12:25pm hit _Saddle Junction_.
- 1:27pm hit Tahquitz Peak ridge. Went through Tahquitz Valley by mistake.
Be sure to take a hard right at the trail split; see last photo.
Otherwise it would have been 15-20 minutes. Probably totaled 9 miles instead of 8.5 because of this.
- 1:50pm leave summit ridge. Did not go all the way to the summit for fear of slipping off trail.
- 3:06pm return to trailhead parking lot.

1700ft of the 2500ft elevation change is done in the 2.5 miles heading from
the trailhead to the _Saddle Junction_.
