This is a modified version of the _Instant Tamale Pie_ recipe found in
[__Moosewood Restaurant New Classics__](http://www.moosewoodcooks.com/products-page/cookbooks/moosewood-restaurant-new-classics/),
which I would highly recommend purchasing. I use a 9.5x13.5x2 inch glass baking dish. 20 minute prep, 30 minute cook.

###Ingredients
- `18 oz` precooked polenta. Lately I have been purchasing from the
[Food Merchants](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_grocery?ie=UTF8&field-brandtextbin=Food+Merchants&node=16310101)
brand.
- `15 oz` can of [Kuner Jalapeno Black Beans with Lime Juice](http://www.faribaultfoods.com/brands/kuners_sw/)
- `1 tsp` cummin
- `0.5 tsp` oregano
- `1 cup` red salsa. I like to go with a dark flavored red salsa. Example:
[Frontera Chipotle Salsa](http://www.fronterafiesta.com/store/gourmet-mexican-salsa/chipotle-salsa/3-3).
- `1 cup` frozen corn
- `1.5 cups` grated cheese

###Process
1. Remove polenta sheath. Slice `0.25 inch` thick; this is slightly less than the width of my pinky.
2. Lay polenta slices, slightly overlapping, in glass baking dish.
3. Mix everything else up, __except__ for the grated cheese, and spread mixture over polenta layer.
4. Sprinkle cheese over top of first two layers.
5. Cook at 350F for 30 minutes.
6. Let sit for 5-10 minutes to cool.
