What makes a breakfast burrito a _breakfast_ burrito? Being a big fan of
[brinner](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brinner) and
burritos, I do not have time for philosophical discussions.
This recipe yields 4 large burritos.

###Ingredients
- large tortillas. Colorado has _La Favorita_ branded foods; their tortillas
probably have the lowest sodium content around.
- 2 [russet potatoes](http://www.produceoasis.com/ProductDetailPage/TabId/272/pid/408/Vegetables/Russet-Potato.aspx)
- 4 eggs
- `0.5 cups` of diced green onions
- `0.25 cups` olive oil - pure (cheaper) or extra virgin makes no taste difference
- `2 cups` grated cheese. I like a colby-jack mix.
- green chile and/or red salsa. big fan of
[505: Roasted Green Chiles](http://www.505chile.com/products.aspx) and
[Private Selection: Firey Habanero & Chipotle Salsa Hot](http://www.privateselection.com/artisan-products/snacks/salsas/)
respectively.
- `15 oz` can of refried beans
- sour cream
- pepper, salt, garlic powder

###Process
1. Peel and [rice](http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/Potato-Ricer.htm)
your potatoes. Ricing can be imitated by finely grating and then pressing out
the preponderance of the moisture content.
2. Put the olive oil in a large frying pan and evenly distribute the potato
mash over the oil. Start frying (on medium-high) as soon as possible to prevent
the potato mash from discoloring.
3. Fry until the bottom of the mash has browned/hardened. I typically throw on
some pepper and garlic powder at this point. Add a pinch of salt if you are
into that sort of thing. And flip the potato pancake. Let the other side cook
for 5 minutes and break apart with spatula into small tater-tot sizes. 
4. Continue to monitor and break as needed for 10 minutes.
5. Dump the potato hash onto plate. Scramble the 4 eggs along with the green onions.
6. Turn off stove-top and use the remaining heat and oil residue to prep your
4 tortillas.
7. Portion out the grated cheese, potato, egg, and onion mix into the tortillas.
8. Throw in 3-4 spoonfuls of refried beens into each burrito.
9. Cover the tops of the rolled tortillas with sour cream
and chile/salsa product of choosing.
10. Serve with fresh cut bell peppers.
