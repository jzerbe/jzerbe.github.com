Highlights of early January (7-11) 2016 trip around South Florida.

### Lodging
[Beachwalk Resort](http://beachwalkresortfl.com/)
is a [10 minute walk from public Hallandale Beach access](https://goo.gl/maps/EbtbcB8f7rE2).
We stayed on the private residence side (East) of the complex in a
[3BD/3BA Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11756131). Great unit owned by _Real_.

Only snafu was getting keys from the night manager ~12:30am. Next day, one of the day concierges
had things wrapped up in 10 minutes. The parking is valet-only, but we never tipped ... and
there was no damage to our rental car with Georgia plates.

Ground level pool, [rooftop clubhouse/pool](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/0r80ul513n1ivcw/AACTBELR5po8bjtAOVT_G1cGa),
fitness center, largely (foo-foo) Brazilian clientele.
Good [views East and South](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/2futh9gba432ovm/AACJsZFJeUvFCtWZ39wrb26ha) on the unit patio.

### Eats
Within walking distance:

- Very late lunch at [Padrino's Cuban Cuisine](http://www.yelp.com/biz/padrinos-cuban-cuisine-hallandale-beach-2)
on Friday. Flavors were on point. Be sure to grab some coconut beans and rice.
- Dinner ~6:15pm at [Il Mercato Cafe & Wine Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-mercato-cafe-and-wine-bar-hallandale-beach).
We got ahead of crowd and even then they only had space outside; wind protected, quite nice.
Get the _Grilled Artichoke_ and _Squash Ravioli_.

### Everglades
Had hit this park in a previous Florida Keys trip, but the weather seemed favorable enough
and we needed something to do. Unfortunately, the water levels were particularly high this year.
The local rangers advised against doing any of the
[Flamingo Trails](https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/flamingo-trails.htm) unless we had the gear.
Not going to happen with the whole family.

Not to worry, the [Long Pine Key Trails](https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/long-pine-key-trails.htm)
sit higher than surrounding areas. A quick out and back from
[_Gate 4_ to the first hardwood hammock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvZ18wd0VHUXRoMlU/view) (going West)
was a decent compromise; it is double track the whole way.
Look for [Gate 4](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/w6xs3rllc1d2op0/AADUHV9sijnwOfshH8phsQlta) a bit North and on the West
side of the road from the main campground area and the
[Jurrasic Park looking structure](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/4bl99daepatqjtt/AACsk2mkd_HVcT3YaVQFsMUya).
At the only fork, follow the [trail to the left](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/ylktxjsnaz42cmb/AADKtq_ndt2WYul5-2slSp1Wa)
instead of back to the main road North (right); a fifth of a mile at this point.

Derped around on <https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/anhinga-trail.htm>
and <https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/gumbo-limbo-trail.htm>. Allegedly
[vultures _will_ damage your vehicles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B611viYGQAn5SnpzcVc4eGlHT0k/view).
We did not see any, nor was this sign here 5 years ago. At least my
[dad looked fabulous in a tarp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B611viYGQAn5S01MRDdiRUUwWXM/view)
to head to our car during a rainstorm.

### Hobe Sound
[Combined a trip](https://goo.gl/maps/X4iyNVZ5LcH2) North to
[Blowing Rocks Preserve](http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/florida/placesweprotect/blowing-rocks-preserve.xml)
and
[Jonathan Dickinson State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Jonathan-Dickinson).

Take a look at the  [Blowing Rocks images](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/w06mvs78u3xzvlf/AACHWIvJhaGWG6qK9wtl8mm1a)
and you will understand the name. According to one of the interns that ran a quick tour, the diving
is fantastic during the spring and summer.

Rented a kayak at the river side concession in Jonathan Dickinson for an hour or so to get some upper body exercise.

### Tennis Courts
Got some tennis in before checkout.
The [nearest public courts](https://goo.gl/maps/GVhgRQhafJw) were empty at 9am.
