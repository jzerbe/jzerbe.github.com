Meal suggestions with a couple different kinds of squash.
Microwave 8-10 minutes in a pyrex container with 3 Tbs of water in the
bottom is usually a good starting point;
you should be able to easily slide a fork into the fruit.

### acorn
Green with ridges.

Great to add to chilis, soups, and curries as it dissolves quite easily into the dish.
Pair with [couscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous), refried beans, cheese,
and green chili for fast lunch or dinner.

### butternut
Long, off-white/orange, traditional gourd looking, this squash is sweeter
and more solid than other squashes when prepared.

Add cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar, and you have a much faster
pumpkin-ish dessert.

### spaghetti
At the grocery, you are looking for an oval fruit with off-white shell color.

Stringy like spaghetti when scraped out of the shell,
this squash works great for adding more texture and mellow flavors.
