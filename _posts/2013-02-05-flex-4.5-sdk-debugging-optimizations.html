<strong>max the JVM heap</strong><br />
Open the file <code>bin/jvm.config</code> in the root of your SDK install.
Update the <code>java.args</code> line to look like
<code>java.args=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false</code>.
Even on one of the latest MacBook Pros with ~2.8x4 GHz and 16GB of RAM,
the debugger would barf if I told it to allocate more.<br />
<br />
<strong>modify Firefox Flash plugin timeout</strong><br />
Enter <code>about:config</code> in the URL bar. The field we are going to
modify is called <code>dom.ipc.plugins.timeoutSecs</code>; the
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Plugin-container_and_out-of-process_plugins#Plugin_hang_detector">
    default is 45 (seconds)
</a> which is not nearly enough of an outing for a decent break point gala event.
I like having mine set to 600 (10 minutes).
