Whistler Blackcomb is a whole lot of mountain,
as [Powderhounds](http://www.powderhounds.com/Canada/Whistler-Blackcomb/Ski-Resort.aspx) rightly points out:

> There's significant potential you'll lose your friends or family.

> Whistler Resort has a mile long vertical drop.

Both are quite accurate and were important factors in my experience.

### The snowboarding destination
Whistler Blackcomb is the measuring stick my Canadian uncles have been using for years to describe other
resorts by. When the resort showed up for the first year on the
[Epic Pass](https://www.epicpass.com/passes/epic-pass.aspx) for the 2017-2018 season, I knew it was time.

> As to be expected for a ski resort with mile high vertical, the snow conditions between the top and bottom can be amazingly different.
> On the lower parts of the mountains it can be raining and the snow may be very slushy, but there is significant snowmaking capacity to ensure adequate snow coverage.

This hit home hard for me coming from Colorado. After this trip I had a new found appreciation
for the Arc'teryx Gore-tex triple layer line of products. Never again would I endure
having a jacket freeze to me. How can you be mad though when the top 2/3 of the mountain is
bombing snow? We got tremendously lucky and each day there was 1-2 feet of fresh snow!

Usually it is best to look at the mid-mountain report and just stay high: <https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Whistler-Blackcomb/6day/mid>

### Getting there
United flies direct Denver to Vancouver and they have a great
[Sports equipment](https://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/travel/baggage/sports.aspx?POS=US) policy for
_Ski and snowboard equipment_:

> Up to two snowboards in one bag and one snow boot bag

> If the combined weight of the ski bag and boot bag is over 50 pounds (23 kg), applicable overweight charges apply.

In reality as long as you have a snowboard bag that is not over 50 pounds, they don't really care.
On top of that, I run the [United MileagePlus Explorer Business Card](https://creditcards.chase.com/small-business-credit-cards/united-mileageplus-explorer-business),
so I have not had to pay checked bag fees ... ever.

If you have a large enough crew, get a van rental, like <https://whistlervan.com/collections/private-shuttle-for-group-booking>.
If not, Avis does offer one-way car rentals from the Vancouver Airport to their [Whistler location in a hotel](https://www.avis.com/en/locations/ca/bc/whistler/wh9).
Ended up refueling my rental at the [closest Chevron](https://goo.gl/maps/4mgEtMq7nL12) I could find.

### Lodging
Booked a spot 4 months in advance on the Blackcomb side and it was absolutely worth it.

Love that view from the rooftop hot tub!

Walking distance to food and lifts.

### Groceries and snacks
If you have a car or other means of transporting more groceries at a time, then I suggest hitting
<http://www.igastoresbc.com/> for better prices. If you want to walk to a grocery store, head to
<http://whistlergrocery.com/>.

### Eating out
[Sushi Village](https://sushivillage.com/reservations/) has some great private booths. We were able to squeeze all 12 of our crew in!

[The Tandoori Grill](http://tandooriwhistler.com/) has a great low key ambience and properly Tandoor prepared food.

Finish the night at [Dubh Linn Gate Whistler](http://whistler.dubhlinngate.com/) and hope [_Ruckus Deluxe_ are playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTK4HK9TORA).
