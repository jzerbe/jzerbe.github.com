The first time I have been snowmobiling in probably 5 years!
Gorgeous day snowboarding via snowmobile above Leadville around Turquoise Lake and up in the mining district on the East side of town.
Much lower traffic areas than the typical snowmobiling destination of Vail Pass.

Given the [Sawatch Avalance forecast](https://avalanche.state.co.us/forecasts/backcountry-avalanche/sawatch/),
early season snow,
[grooming reports for Leadville](https://www.snowmobilecolo.com/content.aspx?page_id=1980&club_id=45117&module_id=1980&area_id=19#search_results),
and my mediocre technical abilities on a snowmobile, we stuck to two areas with low slide probability.

Grabbed some beers and eats at [Periodic Brewing](http://periodicbrewing.com/) after.

### Turquoise Lake

Only a few spots of exposure to potential slide paths that cross CO-4 on the South side of the lake.

Gorgeous meadow South of _Uncle Bud's Hut_ before we tracked it out.

### Mining District

No real slide exposure, just watch out for the old mines.

3 slides above treeline on the South and SE faces of Little Evans Gulch.
