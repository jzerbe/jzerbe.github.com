First in a three part series on Arches and Canyonlands trip over May 1-3.

###The Drive
It is about 5 hours to drive from the junction of
[6th Ave and I-70W](https://goo.gl/maps/t1knS) at the edge of the Denver Metro
to the entrance of [Arches National Park](http://www.nps.gov/arch/). Stopped
off in [West Vail to get gas with 3.5 hours left](https://goo.gl/maps/h0UDP).
Be aware that there is __no__ gas from Fruita until
[exit 187 for Thompson](https://www.google.com/maps/search/gas/@38.9867928,-109.6659986,10z),
one exit before 182 to get onto US-191S.
[Standard cars are $10](http://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm)
to get into Arches.
Plan to throw $20 total on your card if you are doing Canyonlands as well.
Showed up around 1:30pm, sat at the picnic tables outside the visitor center
and slammed some lunch, before driving up the entrance road. I am a firm
believer in bypassing most visitor centers and catching it on the way out for 5
or perusing the web later.


###Delicate Arch
If you check out the
[park map](http://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/upload/ARCHmap.pdf),
it may seem as though this arch is a bit of drive.
If you get lucky, and are not stuck behind _tourists_, it is possible to make
it over to the Wolfe Ranch trailhead/parking/toilets in 15 minutes. Can get
very busy; so we hit it on a Thursday afternoon. The trail upslope faces West
the whole way. Lucked out on the relatively low temperature of ~70F.

- 3 miles RT; ~1.25 hours total; 300 ft? elevation change;

###The Windows
Heading back out of the park, hit _The Windows_. There was reasonable parking
and pit toilets. Definitely suggest to hit the back-side via the
_Primitive Loop_: less people, better pictures (including the La Sal Mountains).

###Balanced Rock
Almost immediately after, heading out, there is a turn-out for the phallic
_Balanced Rock_. Snapped some pics. The official member is the last one in the
photo series. Rather bored by this point; good thing we only allocated
the afternoon to Arches.

###Eats and Sleeps
- [Moab Valley Inn](http://www.yelp.com/biz/moab-valley-inn-moab) was a place to
stay. Booked it for the price, free breakfast, pool/jacuzzi, and free Wi-Fi.
Some interesting noises to be heard from the campground out back.
- [Mi Ranchito Mexicano](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mi-ranchito-mexicano-moab) has
probably the best Mexican food I have had since leaving LA. Right across the
street from the hotel. ~$10 for the special: beans/rice/tortillas/chips,
tamale, and chile relleno, tall drink of horchata. Hell to the yeah!
