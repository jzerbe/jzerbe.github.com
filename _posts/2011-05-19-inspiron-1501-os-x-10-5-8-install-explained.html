<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jasonzerbe/status/59849509177524224">A month ago</a> I was able to successfully install
a working OSX 10.5.8 install on my Dell Inspiron 1501 for a more enjoyable development experience. Having a
bunch of scripting languages, sdks, gnu tools, all wrapped in a sexy UI makes for a lovely time. I finally
took the time to document said process. Be forewarned however that dual-booting with a Linux distribution
or Windows could make the network interfaces have issues.<br />
<br />
I essentially followed this guide - <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/osx1501/inspiron-1501-guide/mac-os-x-leopard">Installation of OS X 10.5.8</a> -
to get a working system, but there are a few things left out. All the files that are mentioned (which you will need) in the
above tutorial I made local copies which you can also obtain here:
<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44649188/blog_hacks/osx-inspiron-1501_drivers.zip">osx-inspiron-1501_drivers.zip</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dual Booting</strong><br />
I found the easiest way to get dual booting working properly with OSX and Windows XP was to 1) format the HDD
with gparted (can be found as an <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">independent bootable system</a>
or a componenet of many Linux distros) - create a HFS+ and NTFS partition, 2) install Windows XP, and then 3) install
OSX from your iDeneb disc (so that the Chameleon bootloader is installed properly).<br />
<br />
<strong>Installing the Audio Driver with the Kext Helper</strong><br />
What the tutorial fails to state is that: you should <em>not start</em> the Kext Helper application by <em>double clicking</em>,
but should instead <em>drag the codec text dump</em> (Sigmatel9200.text) <em>onto the application icon</em>, which will then
start the application and patch the system. See
"<a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t44972.html">Linux codec dump for SigmaTel 9200 (How to do?)</a>"
on the insanelymac.com forum for more information on creating your own codec dump (probably not necessary as I found out the hard way).<br />
<br />
<strong>Quartz missing</strong><br />
The Mac OSX <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(graphics_layer)">Quartz (graphics layer)</a> does not
work with the Inspiron 1501 hardware. Thus, several noteable visual applications do not work properly, namely VLC.
Instead of installing VLC, I was able to play many of the same files with <a href="http://www.perian.org/">Perian</a>
installed (in conjunction with QuickTime).
