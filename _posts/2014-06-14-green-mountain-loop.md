If you live around the northwest Denver metro, and are looking for a place to
grind on hill climbing, then _William F Hayden Green Mountain Park_ is
a pretty good place to hit. Not particularly scenic, but certainly some
variable training terrain.

Hit the trails ~8:30am, with my partner, to low levels of people and
returned to a similarly low-key parking lot for a Saturday morning ~10am.
M/F pit toilets at parking lot.
