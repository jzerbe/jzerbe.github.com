Recently my Dell Inspiron 1501 battery has been acting up. The problem started out
with the BIOS spurting out an error message at bootup, which I though was merely a glitch:

        WARNING: The battery cannot be identified.
        This system will be unable to charge this battery.
        Press Any Key to Continue
        Press  2 times to enter SETUP
        Press  and Any Key to enter Boot Menu

The battery would not hold charge and XP (32bit and 64bit) would be unresponsive
to my keyboard and mouse clicks/movements while the battery was installed. I decided to pop out
the battery and see if it would run faster, which it did.

All in all, the battery just was getting old and would no longer hold charge.
Installed a new one and it worked like a champ.
