Fall potluck and I needed a finger food to bring. I had some spices and sweet potatoes lying around.
It is now cold enough for baking and I wanted to try something new.
Sure, you can marinate meat, but why not other absorbent foods?

This serves enough for 8 people as an appetizer.

### Items
- `2` large sweet potatoes
- `1` anaheim pepper diced
- `1` jalepeno pepper diced
- `0.25 cup` [roasted green chiles](https://www.505southwestern.com/roasted-chiles)
- `1.5 cup` canola/vegetable oil
- `2 Tbsp` cinnamon
- `1 tsp` chili powder
- `1 or 2` tortilla bags - depending on how confident you are in the 1st bag to not leak

### Process
1. Peel sweet potatoes. Does not have to be perfect.
1. Cut your sweet potatoes the short way such that you end up with circles.
1. Cut the sweet potato circles into 3rds or 4ths to get the widths below a finger width.
1. Dice your peppers into sizes no bigger than a finger nail.
1. Throw all your items in the bag, seal, and give it a good shaking to mix all the spices and oil in with the vegetables.
1. Marinate 1-2 days turning every 12 hours.
1. Put the contents on a baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes at 400F, then broil for 5 minutes to get a brown bordering on black finish.
