This is day 2 of 2 (Sunday) in South Yosemite, or rather just the morning,
as we had planned.

Do note that parking right next to the grove was packed out by the time we
finished up around 11am, and people were being diverted to the shuttles;
wide open parking at 8am.
The easy _Outer Loop Trail_ route we took will not be available during the
[_Restoration of the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias Project_](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/mariposagrove.htm);
you will probably have to hoof it 12 miles RT from Wawona.


###Timetable###
- 8:20am start from the
[Outer Loop trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5028996,-119.60993,106m/data=!3m1!1e3)
- 9:45am reach [Wawona Point](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5186283,-119.6006758,105m/data=!3m1!1e3)
- 10:00am leave Wawona Point
- 10:50am return to car via _Clothespin Tree_

The _Outer Loop Trail_ takes you up and NE along the North ridge,
away from much of the lower, touristy grove. Near the top, back track NNW on
an abandoned? asphalt access road to the top of Wawona point (1200 ft up).
At least the microwave radio substation does not block the view.

On the return we hit the tram asphalt and cut into the lower grove as a shortcut.
