Prior to rolling into town during what seemed to be an unseasonably wet weekend, I had my eye on
riding [Doctor Park](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/42669). Reading the warnings about stream traversal
and always damp conditions had me bail on that idea pretty fast.

I thought I found something similar in [Eccher Gulch](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/6444572).
