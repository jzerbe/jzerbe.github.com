This is the third of three days spent around Las Vegas doing non-Vegas things.

For a good overview, see the U.S. National Park Service page:
[Lake Mead National Recreation Area - Arizona Hot Spring](http://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/hikeazhot.htm).

### Trailhead
Drive from sleeps to the trailhead
[via US-95 and US-93 through Boulder City](https://goo.gl/maps/guwBQ)
was uneventful. There was 10 minutes of delay in Boulder City at the left turn
to stay on US-93.

Started from ~11:30am; returned to ~3:30pm. Spent ~60 minutes in the hot spring
canyon. Spent ~30 minutes lunching in the last mile stretch. Comes out to be
~2.5 hours in motion. Most of us run 1-3 miles at least once a week.

### Upper Hot Spring Canyon route
This is the least technical route and clocking at ~5 miles round trip, the shortest route.

I suggest looking over the NPS leaflet for this trail walk through to make more
sense. Sources: [NPS.gov](http://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/upload/Arizona-Hot-Spring.pdf) or
[Google Drive mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvSE9lcnItbGwwd3M/view?usp=sharing).

1. After crossing under the US-93 over pass, head to the left, following the
fence until you are on top of the [flat access road](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvTjkxVlA2azJ3WDQ/view?usp=sharing).
2. Continue on top of the burm, if you see [trail signs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvZ0VVN0FuTkJkMHM/view?usp=sharing),
you are on the right track.
3. In a short while you will see [a hiking sign](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvU05zMXZHTkVXRFE/view?usp=sharing),
pretty soon, the tracked down area will proceed down to the left into a wash, then back up onto another hill.
4. If you have followed the path correctly, 15-20 minutes in you should spot where the
[upper and lower routes diverge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvWkItMmRvNVNpU0k/view?usp=sharing).
Proceed straight for the upper route.
5. Once over the ridge, follow the [immediate canyon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvcWJKcHBvcUQyNmM/view?usp=sharing)
down through a few more. The hard-pack trail is really easy to follow.
6. You end up in the [gravel wash](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvWUhyVlVvdS1RRjg/view?usp=sharing)
where the lower route connects in. Make note of [the cairn](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yT30uCaFvvUDZHaHhtSFhVUzQ/view?usp=sharing)
for the return trip.
7. Follow the wash until you hear water and/or see half-naked people.

### Hot Spring
Traversing the filled pools requires ginger foot-work and a tolerance of heat next to the vents.
Bring water shoes or sandals if you have a low pain tolerance and want to keep
your nostrils as far away from the amoeba as possible.

The best pools are on this side of
[_the ladder_](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5WFF0WjhoZ2tZZmc),
with a
[ruggedly romantic](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5TjVualdxaXVIRlk)
ambiance. If you are feeling adventurous like
[your guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5TVVsN3dBdTMzNTA),
then portage your boots through the several feet deep pool, put them back on,
and climb over the 20 feet drop-off on a slippery metal ladder.

I was able to [jump](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5X1k1U1lLSzBoQnc),
[crab-walk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5VlJrcnVUaWFLMWs),
and [lope](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5d0VJaDBWOS1JTmM)
my way down to the [Colorado river](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B611viYGQAn5YjZ0Z0NwNWlYekE)
without needing to take my boots off again. Absolutely beautiful.
Well, maybe not the pit toilets down there!
