### Timetable ###
- 8:15am start via _Shanahan Ridge_ Trailhead. Note: you are at the edge of a housing development.
Need to piss? Hold it in for 1-2 miles.
- 9:42am summit. Bring gloves for wind, snow, and bouldering. ~2800ft elevation gain.
- 9:50am leave summit
- 11:02am return to car

1:27 ascent. 1:12 descent. The last half-mile or so after hitting the summit ridge is a bit of a scramble in places.
A little bit of slush here and there.
