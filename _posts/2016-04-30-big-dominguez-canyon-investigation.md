Third of three-ish days around Grand Junction.

### overview
Shout-outs to [Scott Bacon](http://www.scottbacon.net/) on telling me about this area;
if there is an area with cultural/natural beauty in Colorado, he probably has photography of it.

Old area map below (used to be wilderness study area), but some better details than the BLM
[PDF](http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/co/field_offices/denca/pictures_new/d-e_nca_general.Par.76303.File.dat/DENCA%20Brochure.pdf)
or [GDrive mirror](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0yT30uCaFvvZllWdmwwM3BkNmM).

### standard trips
Most people who want an enjoyable half-day can head up Big Dominguez canyon and head back down;
great write-up on gjhikes.com [_Big Dominguez Canyon_](http://www.gjhikes.com/2009/10/adominguez-canyon.html).
We certainly enjoyed ourselves.

Another option mentioned in literature
[PDF](http://www.oriconline.org/what_to_do/trails_and_trips/backpacking_trips/ii-big_dominguez_canyon_backpacking_trip.pdf)
is to go all the way up and out of Big Dominguez. After that, walk back down Little Dominguez.

### possible early crossing
My question: is an early crossing possible? Before hitting the trail junction with _Cactus Park_, is it possible to
take the _Big Dominguez Dry Fork_ to a point that connects with _Poison Canyon_?

The closest thing to anyone posting about this I could find:
[_Jess and Jo go backpacking_](http://sedimentarylifestyle.blogspot.com/2012/06/jess-and-jo-go-backpacking.html)

Based on the horse trail I found, the locals probably know a route. I did not get onto _Star Mesa_ due to time
constraints, but it looks very plausible without rock climbing gear from the _Big Dominguez_ side.
