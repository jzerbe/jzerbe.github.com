### Hawkeye Road
The proper Kokopelli MTB trails were way too sloppy for riding, so instead of damaging the trails, we zipped up and
down Hawkeye Road. Was not about to take my dad on anything more than greens or double track. Solid start to the day.

### Devil's Canyon
My dad and I did this in 2.5 hours at our standard _cranking_ speed.
Add 45-60 minutes for most groups.

Map based on map found on gjhikes.com:
[_Devil's Canyon D3 Trail_](http://www.gjhikes.com/2009/10/devils-canyon-d3-cabin-route.html).
KMZ from the minified map should serve you fine.

### eats
Friday night seemed much more lively than Thursday night on Grand Junction Main Street. Go to
[Rockslide Brewery and Restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rockslide-brewery-and-restaurant-grand-junction-2)
and get the _Poblano Pork Tacos_ and _Big Bear Oatmeal Stout_.
