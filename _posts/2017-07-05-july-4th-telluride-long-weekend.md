Trip notes for another glorious long weekend with a great crew ... in Telluride and Ouray.
Do note, the bike park in Telluride is __FREE__. How about a video of the bike park? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUJCVycL8NM>

## Friday June 30
Left Boulder ~3:30pm, for an arrival ~11pm at the AirBnb.
Check in was not until after 4pm anyways.
It is a 6.5 hour drive with no stops.

## Saturday July 1
Picked up mountain bike rentals at the base of the Telluride gondola: https://rentals.bootdoctors.com/rent/mountain-bike

Took the gondola up and spent the morning and early afternoon on: https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/3267247/prospect

Made it back to the Mountain Village side of the gondola bound for the Telluride side of the gondola via the cruisy: https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/3267041/village-trail

Had a very late lunch ~3pm? at [Maggies Kitchen](https://goo.gl/maps/fcTWquZUwEH2), because every other brewpub in town was packed out.
They have a great back patio (which is upstairs).

## Monday July 3
Dinner at https://www.yelp.com/biz/smugglers-brewpub-telluride was glorious!!!

## Tuesday July 4
Booked a [_Family Rock Climbing - Half Day_ for $350 with Mountain Trip](https://mountaintrip.com/local-telluride-mountain-guides/telluride-rock-climbing/) to take us up the _Pipe Line Wall_ at the head of the canyon.
It was my first time climbing outside ... terrifying, but fun!
~10am fighter jets from Colorado Springs buzzed overhead for Telluride's 4th of July parade.

## Wednesday July 5
Headed home.
