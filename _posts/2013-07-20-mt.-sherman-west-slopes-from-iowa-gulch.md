While this is the first 14er post, earlier this season I had done
[Quandary Peak - East Ridge](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=quan1&peak=Quandary+Peak)
and
[Mt. Bierstadt - West Slopes](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=bier1&peak=Mt.+Bierstadt).

###Timetable###
- 6:15am going north on I-25
- 8:20am start via _West Slopes_ trailhead
- 9:50am summit
- 10:15am leave summit
- 11:10am return to car

1:30 ascent. 0:55 descent.
Close fitting work gloves made going over the scree field and top boulders much easier.
