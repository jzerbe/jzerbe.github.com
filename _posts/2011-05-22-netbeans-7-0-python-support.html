Upgrading to Netbeans 7.0 had a bunch of perks, my personal favorites being: the faster cold and warm start-up times,
Git support, and (what seems like) faster C++ library refresh/load times. The down-side to this update was
the lack of out-of-the-box Python support. Fortunately there is a quick fix for this.<br />
<br />
From Wade Chandler, in response to "<a href="http://forums.netbeans.org/ptopic38275.html">Howto activate python in NB 7.0</a>" on the netbeans forums:
<blockquote>You can use the dev auto update center. Python seems to still work though I'm a python newbie:

So, from the main NetBeans IDE window menu bar:
<ol>
    <li>Tools-&gt;Plugins (which opens the Plugins window)</li>
    <li>Select the "Settings" tab</li>
    <li>Hit the "Add" button (bottom right)</li>
    <li>enter "Last Stable Build" and "http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastStableBuild/artifact/nbbuild/nbms/updates.xml.gz"</li>
    <li>go back to the "Updates" tab and hit the "Reload Catalog" button</li>
    <li>This should give you access to the latest stable build (development) plugins, which should allow you to install the Python plugins of your choosing</li>
</ol>
