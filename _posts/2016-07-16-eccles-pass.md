For how close the trailhead is to Frisco, I am surprised that I was one of 8 cars at the lot at 7:45am.
When I returned ~12pm, there was a line of vehicles about a quarter of a mile down the forest service road.
No facilities at the lot, but plenty of tall grasses.

The first 2.5 miles in, is nothing but climbing, sometimes over hard boulder wash areas.
Once the trees start thinning, the climb turns to rolling next to _Meadow Creek_ ... until ...
the final push to the pass.

The best time to do this is definitely in high summer, as _Meadow Creek_ and the lakes feeding
it made the nearby ground mushy even on a warm day like today.

Unfortunately the timestamps on the photos got mucked, and they are out of order.
