Hipster hiker here, finally decided to hit the _touristy_
[Grays and Torreys](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=torr5&peak=Grays+Peak+and+Torreys+Peak)
at the tail end of the season. Maybe just as bad during other parts of the season,
as it was Labor Day weekend. Pro-tip: continue South on Stevens Gulch road, past the
trailhead footbridge for
[more parking in the trees](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6594655,-105.7835736,337m/data=!3m1!1e3).

If I do this again, definately doing the
[Southwest Ridge route](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=gray8&peak=Grays+Peak+and+Torreys+Peak)
up from Ruby Gulch. The trailhead looks much more secluded from
[satellite imagery](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6009464,-105.8380849,226m/data=!3m1!1e3).


### Timetable ###
- 7:15am start from the
[Stevens Gulch trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6609008,-105.7845121,127m/data=!3m1!1e3)
- 9:15am summit Torreys
- 9:55am summit Grays
- 11:20am return to car

Missed the hot left to go up Grays first. I think it worked out better doing
Torreys first; the North slope of Grays was icy in places where the sun seems
to miss. I was able to jog down the easy East slope switch-backs of Grays
protected from the wind. That wind on the saddle is brutal ~9am.


### East and West of the continental divide ###
