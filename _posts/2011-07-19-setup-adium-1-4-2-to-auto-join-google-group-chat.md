I tested this process on [Adium](http://www.adium.im/) 1.4.2 on my Mac Pro workstation running OSX 10.6 (at work).

1. Have open the Google Group Chat (tab) you want to auto join in the future
2. In the menu bar: __Contact -> Add Group Chat Bookmark__
3. Open up Adium\'s contact list, right-click/control-click the new Group Chat Contact, and click __Get Info__ in the new menu
4. In the new Get Info window that is brought up, click the __Advanced__ tab
(its the last tab with a chalkboard icon), and select the check box: __Automatically join on connect__
