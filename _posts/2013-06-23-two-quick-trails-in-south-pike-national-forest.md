The two __out and back__ trails in this post are located just South of
[Divide, CO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide,_Colorado)
and East of [Mueller State Park](http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/Mueller).
Based on the [pictures and activity levels at Mueller](https://twitter.com/search?q=Mueller%20State%20Park),
I would guess that by late May, most years these two trails are snow-free.

Seriously updated this report based on reroutes found on _July 9, 2016_.

### Raspberry Mountain route

RT 5.5 miles ~2 hours. A very doable ~1200 ft elevation change one way. No facilities.

### The Crags

_The Crags_ parking is pretty hard to miss by late morning; the level of
families flocking about is high. There is a quick bit of elevation gain in the
first quarter-mile, and 500 ft or so of uphill in the last mile, but for the
most part it stays quite level next to _Fourmile Creek_. RT 3 miles ~1.5 hours.
Pit toilets at trailhead.
