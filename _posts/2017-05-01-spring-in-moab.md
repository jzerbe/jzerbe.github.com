This was a great long weekend trip to Moab Utah and back to Denver Colorado over April 28 to 30th.

## Friday
Leave Denver ~7am.

Stopped in 10:30am-12:30pm for the iconic [Hanging Lake trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/hanging-lake).
[The weather](http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/glenwood-springs-co/81601/month/332169) was crisp and sunny;
it had snowed earlier in the morning and after we finished.
A slight dusting, but nothing unmanageable.
There were about 20-40 other people on the trail, many fewer than usual. Good picknicking spot.

Entered Arches ~3pm and left ~5:30pm. Got in to Moab ~6pm later that day.
[The weather](http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/moab-ut/84532/month/336126) was quite warm by comparison to the powder
day we had driven by in Frisco CO.

On the way South through town to our AirBnb, we stopped in
to <https://www.yelp.com/biz/moonflower-community-cooperative-moab-2>
for cookables and snacks.

Checked in to our AirBnb after that - <https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/17965507> - and met our hosts.
Cooked asparagus, spaghetti squash, and cod out on the patio grill under the stars.

## Saturday
Picked up [Specialized Camber Comp 650B](http://moabcyclery.com/specialized-camber-comp-29/) after 8am.

Took a couple of laps on [Moab Brand Trails - Lazy/EZ Loop](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/366223/moab-brand-trails-lazyez-loop) as an intro ride for my riding partner.

Packed lunch and snacks and ate in the back of my car.

Went up Aztec Butte in the early afternoon: https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7014618/aztec-butte-trail

Dinner at [Jeffrey's Steakhouse](https://www.yelp.com/biz/jeffreys-steakhouse-moab) was one for the books! Called in a 7:30pm reservation the week before.

## Sunday
Checked out of AirBnb right in the nick of time at 11am.

Went biking at a sweet intro to slick-rock trail - <https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/592585/monitor-merrimac> -
with the [parking lot location](https://goo.gl/maps/AuRYAk5PH2w) right next to the trail.
The first part of the trail is a bit of a pain, going through a sand wash, but then it opens up to great slickrock.

Returned bike and headed back to Denver ~2pm.
