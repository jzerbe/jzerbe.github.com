Notes on logistics for Christmas 2015 stay around Winter Park.

### Christmas day commute
[Weather on Berthoud Pass](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=39.7983&lon=-105.7778)
can be substantially different that the surrounding area, and usually stays snow packed much longer
than the I-70 corridor after a storm. A few flakes were coming down at the top. The
[weather in town](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=39.8915168&lon=-105.7610177)
was calm.

### Lodging
[YMCA of the Rockies - Snow Mountain Ranch](https://www.google.com/maps/place/YMCA+of+the+Rockies+-+Snow+Mountain+Ranch/@39.9923118,-105.9962052,12z/)
is North of Tabernash/Fraser and South of Granby.
In good weather, I timed door to WP chair lift (with free parking in Old Town) at 35 minutes.

4 adults in a two queen, two double bed (bunked) lodge room in [Aspenbrook lodge](http://snowmountainranch.org/lodging/).
Private bath. No microwave, fridge, or TV in room. Wi-Fi was most excellent.
Microwave, coffee, hot water in common area on entry level.

$240.46 for night of Dec 25 and 26 with Y membership discount; includes access to all the facilities and
voucher for two to breakfast each morning.
Right next to the cafeteria/dorm style dining hall that has a pretty good spread.

### Jammin' Man
Got in 2-3 hours by myself Dec 25 afternoon. Reasonably warm with some fresh in places.

Took the folks and sister out Dec 26 9am-1:30pm on buddy passes. High of 15F that day?
Kept the slopes reasonably clear. 8 inches of fresh Dec 26 morning.

### Pepe Osaka's Fishtaco
Early dinner Dec 26 at [Pepe Osaka's Fishtaco](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pepe-osakas-fishtaco-winter-park).
Small place with a 15 minute wait when we showed up at 5pm (for 4 person table). Spots for 2 opened up faster.
I had 3 shrimp tacos; 2 would be fine for a normal hunger level.
This needs to be a franchise. __Go there.__ Not saying anymore to set _any_ expectations.
