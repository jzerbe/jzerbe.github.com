Prior to rolling into town during what seemed to be an unseasonably wet weekend, I had my eye on
riding [Doctor Park](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/42669). Reading the warnings about stream traversal
and always damp conditions had me bail on that idea pretty fast.

I thought I found something similar in [Eccher Gulch](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/6444572).
To access this _legendary_ downhill is pretty involved:

1. _CO-135_ to _FS 813.2A_ -> 2.7 miles/500 ft up
1. [FS 813.2A](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/6444227/fs-8132a) -> 2.9 miles/835 ft up
1. 1 mile/500ft down/up through stream gorge on
[Roaring Judy Trail 552](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/6443896/roaring-judy-trail-552)

This will test your mental endurance. You will see no one else on this trail.
You will roll through immaculate aspen groves.
You might even end up lost somewhere between civilization and national forest.

### Route Map
{% include google_maps_embed.html mid="1GxrmgHwzENpKc9qLEEK-74OCFt0" %}

RT ~7.5 miles. 8290ft to 9790ft elevation.
~4 hours including map checks, getting lost a few times, bushwhacking, and early bailing.

We were unprepared for traversing through to _Eccher Gulch_, we should have looped back around on
[FS 813.A2](http://www.mtbproject.com/trail/6443946/fs-813a2).
