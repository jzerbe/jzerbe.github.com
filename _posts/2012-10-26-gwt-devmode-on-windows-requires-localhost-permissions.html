While GWT&#39;s devmode plugin should work out of the box when one is connecting
from localhost to localhost. This is not the case on Google&#39;s own Chrome.<br />
<br />
I have noticed this sort of behavior on Windows
before; it is very particular about specific address matching. 127.0.0.1 !=
localhost on Windows.<br />
<br />
But then why does this not happen on Firefox or IE?<br />
<br />
<strong>the fix</strong><br />
