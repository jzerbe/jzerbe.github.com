Care to go for a drive, a ride through rolling hills, rock crawling,
pine forest speeding, and finish with an easy down slope? Get your
gear prepped and hit Hall Ranch. Be sure to check

and the Twitter account of the
[Hall Ranch Ranger](https://twitter.com/RangerDMorris) for insights
beforehand.

My bike partner showed up and we hit the trail ~9am. Made it to the top of
_Bitterbrush Trail_ (the top bench) ~9:50am, with a rather winded partner.
I will say I was somewhat drippy myself, but not beat. This was my first
serious rock garden, and while I had to get off 5-10 times, it kept me amused.
Low levels of riders (and only riders) until ~10am.
By the time I was coming down _Antelope Trail_ ~10:45am, things were starting
to feel a bit packed, but this is coming from someone used to seeing
one or two people, on reclusive 14ers, every hour or so.

M/F pit toilets and room for 50 vehicles at the _Bitterbrush Trail_ parking lot.
Room for 10 vehicles at the _Antelope Trail_ parking lot.

Kudos to all the volunteers that have put in time cleaning this
beautiful place after the
[September 2013 flooding](http://www.bouldercounty.org/flood/pages/default.aspx).
I was tubing in _North Saint Vrain Creek_ last July, and the creek course
washout is very obvious from _Apple Valley Road_.
