Great bike trail right in the Denver metro area. 30 minutes SW of my place,
past [Chatfield State Park](http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/Chatfield),
lies [Waterton Canyon](http://www.denverwater.org/recreation/watertoncanyon/).
The canyon ride along the river gets more interesting as you head farther up;
it could be a painful ride in direct sun on a warm day. Once you make it up to
the Colorado Trail junction, the pines and deciduous tree provide ample shade.
Did this on a cloudy Saturday morning 8:40-11:20am. Grabbed

on the return ride of a glassy pond section.

6 (light uphill) + 4 (somewhat technical variable terrain) + 6 (light downhill return)
miles = 16 miles in ~ 2 hours 40 minutes
