            <p>
                I think in systems. I probably would have been an economist or forester if I had been raised by different parents.

            <br />

            <p>
                What happens to our company runway and user experience by increasing the number of application servers?
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens to commercial real estate if team productivity increases and companies have lower operational costs from going fully remote?
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens to team productivity if everyone works remote but compensation decreases?
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I bring value by listening, understanding fears, and executing risk-hedged technical plans.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I got my start fitting together software components in my parent's basement.
                I have had the privilege of stewarding high performing teams.
                I have had the pleasure of running pre-sales and product discovery workshops.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I love asking follow up questions, organizing social events, and riding bike and board in unique places.
            </p>
