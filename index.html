            <h5>Advocate + Engineer + Mentor</h5>

            <p>
                I think in systems. I probably would have been a professional trader, instead of amateur, if I had been raised by different parents.

            <br />

            <p>
                What happens to our capital expenditure and user experience by increasing the number of application servers?
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens to diabetes rates if import tariffs increase and corn subsidies stay the same?
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens to team productivity if intra-ownership increases but compensation decreases?
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I bring value by listening and then communicating nuance of a situation in stakeholder appropriate language.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I got my start fitting together software components in my parent's basement.
                I have had the privilege of stewarding high performing teams.
                I have had the pleasure of running pre-sales and product discovery workshops.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                I love asking follow up questions, organizing social events, and riding bike and board in unique places.
