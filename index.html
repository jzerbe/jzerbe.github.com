            <p>
                Professionally, I am most interested in systems.
                Early in my career this manifested as fitting together technical components.
                More recently, I had the privilege of stewarding a high performing team; how do people work best together?
                Now, I am exploring what makes a great software solution for a line of business.

                Personally, I love asking follow up questions, organizing social events, and riding bike and board in unique places.
