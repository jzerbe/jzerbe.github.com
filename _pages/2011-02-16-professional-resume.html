I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities campus, and in May 2012 I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Databases and Networking. Quite the mouthful to get out at career fairs and interviews and still execute the proper handshake.

Are you a recruiter or human resources staffer? Looking for something a bit more "professional" than a project list? Look no further! Below you will find the latest edition of Jason Zerbe's resume in your choice of Office '97 .doc or Adobe .pdf.

In regards to future full-time employment, after my graduation: I am particularly interested in looking for opportunities in Spain/Portugal, the Persian Gulf, Singapore, and the U.S. West coast. Bottom line: I <del datetime="2011-08-15T18:44:41+00:00">would be willing</del> want to relocate to a more interesting locale than Woodbury, Minnesota.
