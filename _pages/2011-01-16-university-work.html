This is an archive of past projects and code-pieces I have worked on thus far in my coursework for getting my B.S. of CompSCI degree. If you have a beef, questions, or comments send me an email: <a href="mailto:jzerbe@vraidsys.com">jzerbe@vraidsys.com</a>.<br />

<strong>CS3081W Labs and the LONG ASS PROJECT</strong> - <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2011/csci3081/">Program Design and Development</a></i> was a rather sneaky course, in that it initially seems like a laid back time, but then the long-term semester project comes to the forefront and suddenly you are up late at night dealing with said bomb that is compounded by your other 3 or 4 classes. But who am I to complain? My partner, George Chao, and I handled it all in stride. It was a good chance to refresh my C++ knowledge (including the many uses of const).<br />

<strong>CS4061 Labs and Homeworks</strong> - <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2011/csci4061/">Introduction to Operating Systems</a></i> was a pretty chill course about POSIX system services provided to the developer. The topic progression as presented by professor <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~chandra/">Abhishek Chandra</a> was logical and easy to follow. Overall it was a rather enjoyable course made all the more so by the shenanigans that Shaun Gosse and I got up to in our homework code. Be forewarned however, that hw5 has some memory issues that need to be resolved.<br />

<strong>CS4041 Assignments</strong> - <i><a href="https://moodle.umn.edu/course/view.php?id=10231">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></i> was a rather time-consuming course for me. There was so much new content that I could have been better prepared for had I not had to take 2021 and 4041 concurrently. I also I am not very talented at constructing valid proofs, which I learned that Computer Science is all about, apparently? Regardless, I generated some pretty cool code that I will have to get working properly one of these days.<br />

<strong>CS2021 Labs</strong> - <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Fall-2010/csci2021/">Organization and Architecture</a></i> was a very interesting course, in that just about all the content of the course (except for expressing oneself in C) was new to me. There were four written assignments and six code assignments (actually five if you don&#39;t count <a href="http://repo.vraidsys.com/p/cs2021/page/decompile-bomb45/" title="bomblab - bomb45">reverse-engineering</a> as coding). Of all of the code assignments I would have to say that the performance lab was the most frustrating for me. I was sitting at 27 times the basline speed on a function for the longest time, hitting my head against a wall. I then decided to go crazy breaking abstraction barriers and lots of stuff you should not do in production code work, which landed me 41 times as fast.<br />

<strong>CS2031 MATLAB dump</strong> - <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Fall-2010/csci2031/">Numerical Computing</a></i> is being phased out and combined into a Calc 3/Linear Algebra course. This new course will be offered in-house by the Computer Science department instead having to take 2031 and Calc 3 (from the math department) seperately. The whole point of 2031 was how to do approximations on computer systems: taylor series, polynomial interpolation, splines, numerical derviation/itegration.<br />

<strong>CS1902 Homeworks</strong> - <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2010/csci1902/">Structure of Computer Programming II</a></i> had a plethora of <a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2010/csci1902/index.php?page=./homeworks">homework assignments</a> and <a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2010/csci1902/index.php?page=labs">labs</a> writing (mostly) interesting Java applications. Quite a few useful topics were covered including heaps, hash-tables, dictionaries, debugging, and project management stuffs, to name a few. Below are zip files of the Netbeans project directories for the six homework assignments from the class. Homework 6 was a complete flop for pretty much the entire class, although it would probably be good practice to go back and fix it one of these days.<ul>

<strong>Final Project for CS1901</strong> [<a href="http://repo.vraidsys.com/p/cs1901/downloads/2/">ZIP</a>] - The <a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Fall-2009/csci1901/index.php?page=project">final project</a> for <i><a href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Fall-2009/csci1901/">CS1901 - Structure of Computer Programming I</a></i> was to build a computer player for the hexagon game (similar to completing squares game) in MIT Scheme. I worked on most of the assignments throughout the semester, including this project, with one of my good friends Iustin Cornea. I thought our computer player would do better than it did. Not like it failed completely ... heck it beat the both of us!
